      "### Exercise 1: Autocomplete using the trie datastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "A trie (also called prefix tree) is a versatile data structure, which often comes in handy in text processing. It encodes a set of strings in a very compact format. The tree structure makes certain operations that are prohibitively expensive with a standard hash table, such as the one used in the Python `dict`, fast and easy. For instance, listing all strings that begin with a given string, or finding the *best* (e.g. most common) string with a given prefix. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this exercise you will implement an auto-complete facility that suggests the completion $c$ with the highest score $S$ conditioned on the query $q$. In other words, you should find the completion that maximizes $S(c|q)$, as written below:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\\arg \\max_{c} S(c|q)\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This will simply be the string with the highest associated score in the subtree rooted at $q$.\n",

      "#### Dataset\n",
      "\n",
      "You will be working with a small toy data set as well as a larger AOL data set derived from real search queries. The AOL data set is surrounded by some controversy, because shortly after its release in 2006 researchers found that the user anonymization was insufficient and people's private information leaked through the query strings, including credit card numbers. To deal with the privacy issues we only include high-frequency queries isssued by many people in our version of the data set.\n",

      "You are now ready to write the `autocomplete` function. The function should be flexible enough that you can use it with different tries. During development it is often most convenient to work with a small \"toy\" data set that you can print to the screen and where you can accuractely predict what the results are going to look like. Once you have arrived at an implementation you trust, it is easy to switch to the larger data set. \n",

      "Finding the best completion is similar to graph search, although actually a little less complicated, since in a tree you never risk visiting the same node more than once. Additionally, the precomputed `max_count` attribute is extremely helpful in guiding the search. To find the single best completion, you merely have to always follow the path with the highest `max_count`. Note, though, that you must keep track of the path to discover what the completion is, since that information is not stored in the goal node. \n",

Nodes are added to a priority queue with a priority of `-max_count` and visited in order. A completion is finished when a node with the final symbol *\\$* is encounted. Thus the algorithm should terminate when `n_best` nodes with a `value` of *\\$* have been explored."

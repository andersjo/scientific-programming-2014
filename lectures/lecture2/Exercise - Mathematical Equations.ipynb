If you are not sure how they are called and how to use them, you can find the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html). In general, it is always a good idea to check with the documentation whenever you feel like there should be a function that does what you want (usually there is), or if you know that it exists, but you forgot the signature (i.e., the number and types of the arguments).\n",

      "Graphs\n",
      "====\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphs are an incredibly versatile and powerful structure that is used today for a wide variety of problems, from transport engineering, social media (think Google, and of course Facebook), natural language processing, to social sciences (think Facebook again).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its success, graphs are a very simple object. They consist of two sets of objects, namely the ***nodes*** (also called *vertices*) and the ***edges*** (also called *lines* or *arcs*). Nodes are typically called $u$ and $v$, and edges are a pair of nodes, e.g., $(u, v)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest (and admittedly somewhat boring) graph has only one node, and thus typically no edges (nodes *can* have edges to themselves, though).\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as we add a second node, we can have an edge (we don't have to, though: nodes in a graph can be isolated). Edges come in two main variants: ***directed*** and ***undirected*** edges. A convenient way to represent the edges in a graph is via a matrix. The number of rows and columns is given by the number of nodes, and each cell of the matrix indicates whether there is an edge between the nodes. Typically, the rows represent the starting and the columns the end nodes. This matrix is called the ***adjacency matrix***.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we have an *undirected* edge $(u, v)$, we can go back and forth between the two nodes, $u$ and $v$, i.e., information can be transmitted in both directions. The adjacency matrix is symmetric across the diagonal.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=undirected.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "In *directed* edges, information can only go from the starting to the finishing node. So if we want to be able to go back and forth betwen $u$ and $v$, we'd have to add two edges, one in each direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=directed.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "Edges can not only have a direction, but also a weight. This indicates the strength of the connection between two nodes. In an unweighted graph, all edges typically just have a weight of 1. Otherwise, we can give the edges whatever value we like to represent probabilities, costs, distances, etc. If the graph is weighted and undirected, the edge has the same weight in both directions. Weighted directed graphs are sometimes called networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=weighted.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why graphs are so powerful is because nodes and edges can represent so many things, and often without oversimplifying things. They can naturally be people and their relations to each other, web sites and their links, cities and their travel distances, states in a game and the actions to get there, or words and their relations to one another."

      "Trees\n",
      "----\n",
      "\n",
      "In many branches of artificial intelligence, a special form of graphs is used, that is called trees. Trees are directed graphs, and have a special node, called the ***root***. This means that all nodes except the root have a parent. Trees are also not allowed to have cycles, i.e., none of the children or grand-children or further-down successors of a node $u$ can be the parent of $u$. Trees are often used for objects with a hierarchical structure, for example XML documents, and have been successfully applied to parsing natural language (ignoring that language sometimes does have cycles). Everything that works on graphs (search, etc.) thus also works for trees, but not necessarily vice versa.\n",

      "Search\n",
      "====\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common (and most useful) operations on graphs is search. We said earlier that graphs are so powerful because they can naturally depict a lot of objects, and search made that even clearer. However, in order to do search, we translate the ***state*** **graph** to a ***search*** **tree**. This is a very important distinction!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the state graph and adjacency matrix we will use:\n",
      "<img src=state_graph.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "The state graph is a representation of the problem, or the world in which the problem occurs. The search tree is \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence was the realization that we can use search in order to find the best next steps in a game. When Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov in chess, much of its success was based on clever search implementations (see also http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/ for an interesting analysis).\n",
      "\n",
      "A game can be modelled as a succession of states, and a goal is any state in which we win.\n",
      "In order to find the best strategy, we depict each game state as a tree node, with the current state as root, and try to find the best path to a goal node. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the important decisions we need to make is how to represent each state, i.e., what kind of information it contains (position of the pieces, whose turn it is, etc.). \n",
      "The children of each node are the states that correspond to the result of some action. So if we are at a point in the game where we have the choice between taking a magic sword or not, the child nodes of the current state are the one where we have the sword, and the one where we don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "We traverse a search-tree by going down the tree to find the best outcome node (with whatever \"best\" is in our case).\n",
      "We can then either return the best node we found, or the path (i.e., the other nodes and potentially the actions that were involved in reaching them) that were visited along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The easiest way to search would be of course to simply look at each node in the tree until we have found our goal. While this is guaranteed to find the goal, it is impossible for most real-life applications. It would either take waaaay too long, or it would simply never finish: some search trees can be gigantic, or infinite (the number of states for a chess game is allegedly something like $10^{10^{50}}$).\n",
      "One way around this is to limit the depth to which you search, and to keep track of the nodes you already visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, tree-search works as follows\n",

      "def search(tree, goal, strategy):\n",
      "    <b>visited</b> = set()\n",
      "    get start node\n",

      "\n",
      "This looks almost like Python, but not quite. The reason is that there are different search algorithms, and they mainly differ in the strategy they use, i.e., what kind of data structure they use in order to decide on the next node to visit (this is a popular job-interview question). We will look at some of the most well-known search algorithms. They apply to different problems, but they all use this basic structure, and only differ in the type of data structure they use for choosing the next state (this is a popular programming interview question).\n",

      "In order to construct a search tree from a problem graph, we first need to choose a start node. We can then use a fairly simple function that generates child (or successor) nodes. In the simplest case, we can just use problems graphs adjacency matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the search tree depends on where we start, it will look different every time. For now, let's see how we search our way starting from node number 7. In that case, the search tree looks like this:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the size of the search space, we can compute the search tree before we start searching by applying the child function ***recursively*** (i.e., we apply the same function to the children's children, and their children, and so forth), or use the child function in the search algorithm to generate the child nodes online.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child function is the most important part of a node, and often, it's all you need. In general, though, search tree nodes need to have 5 components:\n",

      "1. a representation of the state we are in at the node\n",
      "2. the parent node (the one which generated this one)\n",

      "4. the cost of reaching this node from the start node\n",
      "5. the number of steps taken to get to that node\n",
      "\n",

      "In contrast, ***A\\**** is an informed search algorithm, which uses a heuristic to estimate which states should be explored further. \n",

Those two measured are added up to another measure, $f(n)$. Then, we sort all future states by their $f$-values, and expand the one with the lowest $f(n)$.\n",

      "The core idea is that there is no sense in exploring bad states. The question is of course: how do we measure *bad*? This is up to the heuristics. The heuristics can be anything we want, as long as they don't give too pessimistic an estimate. That is, $f(n)$ should never be greater than the true cost.\n",

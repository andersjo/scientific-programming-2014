      "Graphs\n",
      "====\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphs are an incredibly versatile and powerful structure that is used today for a wide variety of problems, from transport engineering, social media (think Google, and of course Facebook), natural language processing, to social sciences (think Facebook again).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its success, graphs are a very simple object. They consist of two sets of objects, namely the ***nodes*** (also called *vertices*) and the ***edges*** (also called *lines* or *arcs*). Nodes are typically called $u$ and $v$, and edges are a pair of nodes, e.g., $(u, v)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest (and admittedly somewhat boring) graph has only one node, and thus typically no edges (nodes *can* have edges to themselves, though).\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as we add a second node, we can have an edge (we don't have to, though: nodes in a graph can be isolated). Edges come in two main variants: ***directed*** and ***undirected*** edges. A convenient way to represent the edges in a graph is via a matrix. The number of rows and columns is given by the number of nodes, and each cell of the matrix indicates whether there is an edge between the nodes. Typically, the rows represent the starting and the columns the end nodes. This matrix is called the ***adjacency matrix***.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we have an *undirected* edge $(u, v)$, we can go back and forth between the two nodes, $u$ and $v$, i.e., information can be transmitted in both directions. The adjacency matrix is symmetric across the diagonal.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=undirected.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "In *directed* edges, information can only go from the starting to the finishing node. So if we want to be able to go back and forth betwen $u$ and $v$, we'd have to add two edges, one in each direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=directed.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "Edges can not only have a direction, but also a weight. This indicates the strength of the connection between two nodes. In an unweighted graph, all edges typically just have a weight of 1. Otherwise, we can give the edges whatever value we like to represent probabilities, costs, distances, etc. If the graph is weighted and undirected, the edge has the same weight in both directions. Weighted directed graphs are sometimes called networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=weighted.png width=450px>\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why graphs are so powerful is because nodes and edges can represent so many things, and often without oversimplifying things. They can naturally be people and their relations to each other, web sites and their links, cities and their travel distances, states in a game and the actions to get there, or words and their relations to one another."

      "Trees\n",
      "----\n",
      "\n",
      "In many branches of artificial intelligence, a special form of graphs is used, that is called trees. Trees are directed graphs, and have a special node, called the ***root***. This means that all nodes except the root have a parent. Trees are also not allowed to have cycles, i.e., none of the children or grand-children or further-down successors of a node $u$ can be the parent of $u$. Trees are often used for objects with a hierarchical structure, for example XML documents, and have been successfully applied to parsing natural language (ignoring that language sometimes does have cycles). Everything that works on graphs (search, etc.) thus also works for trees, but not necessarily vice versa.\n",

      "Search\n",
      "====\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common (and most useful) operations on graphs is search. We said earlier that graphs are so powerful because they can naturally depict a lot of objects, and search made that even clearer. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence was the realization that we can use search in order to find the best next steps in a game. Each game state can be depicted as a tree node, with the current state as root. The children of each node are the states that correspond to the result of some action. So if we are at a point in the game where we have the choice between taking the magic sword or not, the child nodes of the current state are the one where we have the sword, and the one where we don't.\n",
      "One of the important decisions we need to make is how to represent each state, i.e., what kind of information it contains. \n",
      "\n",
      "We search a state-tree by going down the tree to find the best outcome node (with whatever \"best\" is in our case).\n",
      "We can then either return the best node we found, or the path (i.e., the other nodes and the actions that were involved in reaching them) that were visited along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The easiest way to search would be of course to simply look at each node in turn until we have found our goal. While this is guaranteed to find the goal, it is impossible for most real-life applications. It would either take waaaay too long, or it would simply never finish (some search trees can be infinite).\n",
      "\n",

We will look at three of the most well-known search algorithms.\n",

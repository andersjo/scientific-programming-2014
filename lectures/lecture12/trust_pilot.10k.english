very professional and efficient
our parking experience was great .
the staff was very professional and efficient .
we were very quickly checked in and on our way in a comfortable vehicle to our airline .
the pickup when we returned was also prompt , and our car was waiting for us .
i was impressed with the operation and would recommend them .
It was easier to go straight to the source and buy from Pure Formula than those other shopping websites !
The order was filled quickly and correctly .
No problems at all , highly recommended .
Great prices , fast service !
pleasantly suprised !
I found the parts I was looking for much cheaper than at major part dealer sites .
The delivery was fast and the part fit perfectly .
Great service .
No complaints .
You will definitely get more of my business and I will gladly recommend you to friends !
No need to shop anywhere else for labels
Great service and quality
What a fantastic idea for our pets !
This is the greatest thing , Once a month Petflow sends a box of " goodies " for your pet .
Charlotte my ShihTzu got her first one on December 22nd just in time for Christmas .
She got an adorable cow toy , some treats shes never tried before but seemed to like all of them .
And some teeth cleaner that doesn't involve brushing .
I dont know whos more excited about next month 's package Charlotte or me ...
I believe that they did me right .
Honesty and sincerity are very important to have and I think that they have both .
I would definitely recommend them .
products and prices but some are faded .
One Product to big for being a med .
and the color was not what was expected .
I always start here .
Not always the cheapest if you are persistent but always near the top .
Used this site many times .
I always start mysearch here .
Prices change daily and if you want to really research the price continually at many different sites , I have found cheaper cars elsewhere .
However , if you don't have a lot of time to research the price , this site has always been among the top three ( e.g. , cheapest ) of the ten sites I use to reserve a car .
Profesional and reliable
Have been impressed with my most recent order as usually i have to wait a couple weeks before i get mine as its quite a specific prescription .
Have alway supplied a top quality products and service since i started using them 2 years ago .
Would recommend to all .
Took 3 months and having to call credit company to get money back till they got order correct
Very unsatisfied with product .
It was shipped with multiple wrong parts .
It took months to resolve .
They stopped answering my calls to get the right parts so i had to call credit card Company to get a credit before they finally responded .
I wish I would have read thier reviews online prior to buying .
the website is very easy to navigate
the website is very easy to navigate .
The price is reasonable compared with others for the same products .
God hurtig levering
Det rigtige til tiden
Very fine value for money
We were very happy to find out , that we also could take as many river cruises as we liked in the period of the ticket .

I always choose arguscarhire if possible
I travel to Spain 5 or 6 times a year and usually hire an economy mini car .
Arguscarhire have never let me down and neither have the companies that they recommend .
Easy to setup , easy to use , great support team - couldn't ask for more !
I found Textlocal to be really easy to setup and get going with .
Even after I'd done an initial setup myself , I was really pleased to have a phone call from a member of the team asking how I was getting on and offering pointers on how to make the most of the system .
This was really useful as it stopped me going down the wrong line before I'd started !
Working with a charity , I was really pleased at how easy the process to achieve charity status was - the difference in cost makes a big difference to us !
We're already seeing good returns on our investments and I'm sure we'll find new ways of using the system in the future .
Fast and efficient .
The delivery was a lot faster than I expected and I've enjoyed the little unexpected gift .
The website is appealing and user friendly .
Great stuff , I'll surely order again .
Speedy , effortless service .
Very impressed with speed and efficiency of service .

Write as if you're speaking to a friend .
Great service and quality goods
I purchased a cot mattress , recieved in 2 days , and very high standard .
I am delighted with the purchase and would use them again
Ease of creating the itinerary is key for novice travellers , those who will use a service such as this !
Planning a 2 week honeymoon in various parts of Europe was made easy with Viator !
Large , respected company with many good reviews .
Seems that there are always some whiners out the to bad mouth everything , but Viator seems to impress better than 90% of customers !
I will have more to say when we return !
Trader that does what it says on the tin

order with confidence .
yiou wont be disapionted
i brought a beko dishwasher after much concideration , the price was different to other stores which was really good and the other stores didnt have it in stock ready in time for christmas .
after paying for it a member of there team contacted me about my purchase and gave me all the relevent information regarding my dishwasher .
The man on the phone was very polite and helpful even the delivery guys were polite and talkative too .
I would definitely use this website again .
Excellent web site .
Web site is great .
Easy to order .
Excellent service .
Great prices !!
and the fact that they will match other companies is awesome !!
I will never order anywhere else again !
Great service , quick shipment , high cost of shipping and handling
Great Selection - Great Prices
I found the prices , selection and the personalized service to be great .
I would recommend National pen to anyone .
The best damn customer service i have ever received EVER from a online parts store !!!
Good price free shipping waited too long to receive item
Picked the first site that had the remotes that I needed , seemed like a good price and even included batteries , plus free shipping .
Im glad I didnt need these in a hurry because I would have been disappointed .
Would more than likely buy again if I needed an item bad enough to wait for it .
I recommend everyone to buy from PartsGeek .
I oredered 2 wheel bearings/hubs for my ' 09 Prius .
Paid lowest price for the same brand online .
I'm so pleased with Big Tall Direct !
Timely orders , excellent service , superior products - what more could you want ?
The product was top quality and delivered quickly
The price , product and delivery were excellent .
I would buy from them again .
Great product for a great price
The product was as advertised , was shipped quickly and was sold at a good price .
I was very happy with the service .
Brit resident in France buying quality animal food from the U . K
After a year 's worth vet visits my 2 cats were finally diagnosed with fat intolorence and were immediately put onto a Hills special diet .
The local cost in France for this feed was exhorbitant .
After a Google search I came across the Medicanimal website offering the exact same product for almost 50% cheaper WITH FREE DELIVERY !
I find the website incredibly user-friendly and the prices are very favourable .
I do have one comment though , being a French resident with a French e-mail address but also being a Brit with a U.K bank account your website does not allow me to elect which currency I can use .
At times one can be more favourable than the other !
I am wholly satisfied with your company receiving orders overseas within the week and will continue to patronise you .
I am lucky I found this website
I am very happy with the end result and most importantly the customer service I received .
The original order I received was the printed with the wrong color .
I called and spoke to Cindy and she immediately corrected the problem and shipped out a new order with ZERO hassle .
If I am need for something like this again I will definitely use Bottleyourbrands . com without a doubt .
Give them your passport dilemma and Fastport Passport will give you your answer .
If there 's a need to travel then there 's a need for Fastport Passport .
Thank you for prompt professional service .
Great way of selling to any one , anywhere .
Used Ebay for sales and purchases for the past 10 years and it has worked out for me overall .
Only one issue in that time and they took care of it to my satisfaction .
A good source for information and a good way to " window shop " when your stuck indoors on a bad weather day .
Always had good service and advice .
Used Paypal for my buying and selling for the past 5 years and never had an issue they didn't resolve to my satisfaction .
Finally received my order , they need to communicate more .
I ordered on April 30 and finally received my order today , May 23 .
I understand the " Dr Oz " show took them by surprise , but that response is only good for the first few days , then it becomes an excuse .
I understand the frustration folks are going thru , as I filed a complaint with Paypal two days before receiving my order .
The product came to me as discribed and as shown , but the company needs to communicate more with the public or it is going to see more negative comments which could easily be avoided .
Good company , cheap prices .
We ordered the shannon mirror which as made our bathroom complete , very reasonable prices .
Our first mirror was delivered damaged but just emailed the photo across and had a new one sent out straight away . Will definately use this company again , thankyou .
What a brilliant company to order from , we ordered our new hob at 10pm and received it the very next day for free .
Always a smooth transaction !
love this this place
Product good , despatched promptly !
Great boots , really pleased , prompt service .
The part was as advertised .
Very quick service and arrived in good condition .
Would highly recommend this company to anyone .
Quick , easy and informative from Ginger6
Having ordered my computer on a Sunday night at around 11.30 pm i recieved a call on the following Tuesaday from a lady called sharleen to inform me that my order had been shipped for delivery .
Quick , i thought , and a delightful call too .
The following day , Wednesday , my computer arrived well packaged and ready rock and roll .
Couldn't have been better .
Thanks Ginger6 !
The part I needed was sent off very quickly and was exactly what I needed .
Thank you .
I would definitely recommend this company
The service and delivery are both great . Products are first class .
I think they have the biggest selection of vaping products
Both service and item were exellent .
Fast delivery .
Will go back to this company for all my tools from now on .
Price was the best as well
I asked for samples on Thursday , they arrived on Friday .
I placed my order on Friday and received my goods on Tuesday Considering that the order was for worktops and I live in Scotland , I thought this was exceedingly fast delivery .
Staff were very helpful , courteous and friendly .
Products are exactly as advertised .
Would thoroughly recommend this company .
The Best Place to buy PC Games
I've made two purchases on CJ 's for Fallout : New Vegas and The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim .
I have been satisfied by both , being extremely cheaper than the Steam versions .
The Autokey system that CJ 's uses is genius .
I recommend this site to anyone who is a PC gamer !
Terrible service .
Very disappointed .
2 weeks still dont have my item ?
Almost 2 weeks to get my item ?
Then its dropped at a post office and I wont get it for 2 more days !!!!
Ive never seen an online purchase take 2 weeks !!
What a joke !
Get another carrier or work thru Amazon ??
Havent seen the product yet so what can I say ??
Great value - great range of products in one place
They offered a great range from paint to routers , and at good prices and when combined with the multi buy discount & free PP , cant go wrong , would recommend
Good price & quick delivery - what else can you ask for
An expensive product found very quickly and cheapest at that time - not a technical ordering system , so an easy transaction
Great customer service and products at great prices
We ordered a Garden Vac / Blower which compared to other sites was great value , was due to be delivered very quickly and it was .
Unfortunately it was internally damaged , which tooled up could never have known about , but they collected the item the next available working day , and reshipped out a replacement with no quibble , and no extra expense from me , which I think is great service .
Would definatley use them again
Had excatly what I wanted at a good price and was shipped very quickly - Brilliant Service
Website was easy to use - and search as i knew what i wanted , had the item at the best price i could find on the internet , and was able to ship next day delievry at no extra cost .
Was also impressed that the item arrived in a recylced box - very well package and the external box didnt matter that it was an old one - good idea .
Thanks very much and would not hesitate to use again
No complaints so far !
I have had a few deals from Wowcher and I have found them all as described .
I would recommend Wowcher - worth looking at .
Better than some of the other deals sites .
Fantastic fuss free service
I recommend Boiler juice to everyone , really easy to use , speedy delivery , great prices - can I say more .
Thank you for your service
Goods arrived quickly and well packagaed
Happy to buy from Viovet .
Good prices , and had quick delivery for a reasonable extra charge .
Great experience dealing with Home Health ( UK )
Really happy with the monitor and tests I ordered - clearly brand new and well packaged .
I opted for first class delivery which cost very little more than standard - bargain !
Had an email confirming despatch and my purchase arrived really quickly .
Home Health ( UK ) couldn't have done anything better .
Very good service and quality products .
seriously good price , with great discounts .
Correspondence confirmations , shipping and handling without a glitch .
Thank you .
best way to get parts on the web !
partsgeek is best way to buy parts easy to find parts good prices never any trouble in any way thanks
Expedited service !!
I was very happy with the diamond that I ordered .
As soon as the funds were confirmed ( wire transfer) , the friendly staff worked to meet my needs and made sure that I received my product in time by allowing for Sat shipping .
The reason why I didn't give them 5 stars , even though they could have earned it , is because of the delayed time it took to confirm the wire transfer .
... if paying with a wire transfer , make sure to follow up with Brilliance because my wire transfer had an error due to their bank .
Even though the funds had posted on tues , they were not able to verify it .
I wired it on Monday and received the item Saturday , paid $25 extra for Sat delivery to ensure delivery .
Just follow up with them right away and you will be fine !
Overall , I was very please with my experience and I love the diamond I found on their website !
Def would recommend and will buy again from Brilliance !
Super fast shipping and as ordered .
First time I have done business with this company but will not be the last .
Great stuff and great prices
Amazing results every time
each time we have booked airport parking .
nothing is to much trouble , amending mistakes , trouble with my computer , telephone call , always a polite and positive response to whatever the problem .
You can save money
Great price fast shipping
They have great pricing and fast turn around will always check with them first .
Best price and it got here fast
They found the best price for exactly what I needed .
They shipped it fast .
Great cloths for Higher price
These cloths look great , feels great , has a great sense , but also kinda expensive .
I tried to look for coupons but they were always either expired or not available to be used , or only for first timers .
I would buy more cloths from them if the prices were decently cheaper and had greater coupon deals .
Great company .
My online order was promptly processed and items were received in a timely way .
Spot on - kept my ink jet flying
Very quick response time , reasonably priced .
GREAT SERVICE !
GREAT PRICE !
FAST DELIVERY !
I will be doing more business with West Coast Shaving .
Don't know why I wasted so many years with disposable razors , DUH !
Parts geek had the parts no one else did .
Fast delivery of part , easy installation .
Pricing was great , but needed seating selection for medical needs was not and the recent merger of American and USairways probable cause of difficulty .
I really saved on costs for upcoming trip to New York for myself , grand daughter and mother with dementia condition .
Seats on ongoing flight were obtained with no problem .
Flight is USairways .
There were many rows of available seating for the return flight available through American but operated by USairways , and although I selected seats my finalized itinerary showed the selection did not go through .
Spending hours on the phone with Travelocity , USairways and American has not resulted in seat assignments .
American says USairways has to assign the seats .
USAirways has no record of the reservation , though it shows up on American and Travelocity records . Separation will be difficult because of my mother 's medical condition and no one is providing assistance .
Quite a mess for me to resolve .
A little difficult mostly because of pay pal's, first time using it to pay .
I had a little trouble figuring out how to pay with pay pal .
I knew the camera I wanted so that was no trouble .
But changing address and shipping address did not just appear had to do some moving back and fourth through some windows to get everything all set .
The lady at Expedia was DISHONEST . She waited till I gave her my credit info before she told me that the reservation could not be cancelled ..
In contrast Christine at the Hampton Inn was very courteous .
Good value , fast service
Easy to use , cheaper than manufacturer , and fast service .
Great discounted price for a study guide .
Just recieved my used global history study guide from Bookbye and it was in great conditions .
The price was much lesst than it would have cost me new .
Only a couple of dollars plus shipping .
This is true value for I only need it for a couple of weeks before exam .
very good seller !
I receive it very fast and it was perfect !!
Top Class Service
Quick delivery , top class product , would highly recommend this company to anyone .
Many thanks for great service .
Easy to work with and a great value of our buck !
We worked with this company get quotes and comparing them to others , and even though they weren't the cheapest , they were the best value for our dollar .
Wit free laser printing , shipping , file uploading , and small lanyards , usb-flashdrive.com put an offer we couldn't say no to .
When we got our product , all was well except the lanyards were a different color than we asked , but when I mentioned it to the person in charge of our order , they sent us the right color free of charge .
The quality of the drives look great and we can't wait to distribute them .
I know that our office will definitely use this company in the future .
Cheapest site , parts were correct , quick delivery...that 's all you need .
This is my second time ordering from PartsGeek . com and I am actually taking the time to type this because it is a reliable site .
Both times the parts were correct and completely functional , cheapest I was able to find online and it arrived fast .
Definitely a trustworthy site .
Up front ... point review .
Front Point Security the way to go !
I signed up with front point security 5 months ago , and this company is great !
I resided in Florida .
However , the customer service support staff are professional .
I would recommend this company to future consumers .
Also , the online reviews were helpful during the decision making process .
I have used Barrington Sports on a number of occasions & always find the service speedy & efficient .
The goods are good value for money & I would definitely recommend them .
Requested translations for my Green Card application , got it in less than 24 hours !
Was a bit skeptical using that Rev because of the low price compared to the company my attorney advised me to use : So far awesome experience , very fast and good quality translation .
If it goes through the USCIS without problems , then this will really be a 100% positive experience .
Best in the business
The quality of this company is reflected in their awesome products from clothing to vitamins .
Great price and fast service !
Ordered window visors and door handle for my 2000 Ford Explorer .
The price of the parts was cheaper than an auto parts store and shipped in just a few days .
Great site for great products and great prices
I used to work at an Alternative Health Clinic on an Indian Reservation in Tucson AZ and we got most of our supplies from this company .
So I am now becoming a Holistic Practitioner using what I've learned as a nurse at the reservation and my current training .
I have looked at other websites with similar products but feel this company offers the best value and their products are outstanding , and is my " go to " site for my needs .
Thank you !
Good enough for the price saving
They have good prices , support is a little bit slow , but by no means abysmal .
Have purchased from them multiple times and receive the key usually the same day , if not then next day for sure .
Overall they are a good company and i will do business with them again .
Ordered twice and the goods arrived on time promptly .
Would definitely recommend them .
Returning items is expensive !
I bought the windcheater jacket for my husband .
As its my first time buying the product online , I didn't know the size correctly .
The X-large size jacket I bought for him , didn't fit him , so I had to return it back .
As superdry is a very big brand , thought I might be able to return the item in the nearest store but instead they said I had to return it back to the postal address that was sent from .
I posted the item back to the address which costs me about 15 quid .... it was such a hassle .
I do not want to use superdry again just because of this .
What a rip off !
Just paying for returning of an item is such a waste .
Being a very brand , can't they at least make it easy for customers to return their goods !
Liking my decision to purchase from this company .
I was a little skeptical in order this part on line , I read the reviews and noticed that a few of them stated that the part was a bit lighter ( weight wise ) than the original .
I didst find that to be true , I have not installed the part yet but out of the box it was good to the touch , it felt solid and of the same caliber as the original part .
I was surprised by the box that it came in , the part is a tailgate protector , for a pickup truck , it is about 4 " square x 4-1/2 ' long , it came in a box that is 2 ' wide x 3 ' tall and 5 ' long , much overkill in my opinion .
Still I am satisfied with the part , And will definitely order again .
Fast and accurate
I like that it came so fast !
Extremely helpful , and the parts were shipped the same day , I had them the next day !!
Well done !
I emailed to inquire as to exactly what parts I needed , I received an email back within an hour that lead me right to a shopping cart with my items .
I purchased the items and they were shipped the same day .
I had the parts in my hands the next day .
Fantastic customer service experience .
Next time I need parts I will be back .
Dry pleased with the service .
Polite , efficient and on time !
Speedy and very nice staff
Spoke to the staff 2 times over the phone was told when the goods would turn up and they did i have been asked where i got the goods and after the treatment i got from sports and leisure staff i have told all who would like to know thank you very pleased with the goods
Good value reliable service
I have booked a number of Hotels through Alpha rooms lately and they have always come up with the most competitive price compared to their peers .
The customer experience , service and follow up has been impressive and I will continue to make them my first choice when looking for good value quality accomodation .
Only reason they don't get 5 stars is the over the top £5 booking fee for using a credit or debit card - how else are people supposed to pay on the internet ?
Found the part I needed and it was at my door in a couple of days .
I could not find the part locally so I thought I would give PartsGeek a try .
They showed that they have the part in stock , it was easy to find and order .
With in a couple of days I had the part .
Excellent Service - Great Product !
We ordered usb drives with our logo for a customer conference .
The service we received was fantastic , the pricing was on point , they shipped appropriately and on time , and most of all our customers loved them !
We loved the lanyards they are on and they are a sharp product .
I am addicted to Cult Pens !
Just when I think I must have tried all the pens available , they come up with some
New ones .
Most recently Uniball pens in brown/black and green/black-gorgeous .
Service and delivery is always quick and efficient and I love the free gifts , a really nice touch .
I recommend you to all my friends who are also stationery mad .
Very helpful and professional ..
The person I delt with was very helpful and professional .. She was also patient and even helped to offer assistance while I looked for fiscount code ..
It was an exceptional exp ..
Hassel free !
Oh my God , I got my dress today and it 's beautiful , just as I pictured it .
I ordered it and had it in less than two weeks - not a hitch !
Great , reasonable , and professional ................... thanks
this co . is great and the web site is easy to use , as they say DIY
The easy way to get your juices flowing !
This is a hassle free way to get your heating oil at the lowest prices possible .
Fabulous no fault service
The item we ordered was just as expected but would like to comment on the delivery service .
I have ordered many things on line this Xmas and no other parcel company came close to the the service I received , they kept me constantly updated on my delivery and even gave me a 1 hour time slot which at this time of year every min counts wonderful !
good prompt service
I placed an order on the monday and received it on tuesday , unfortunately i had someone elses order :( .
The company were more than helpful to resolve the issue straight away and i had my order the very next day .
I would defiantly use them again and recommend them to others .
If not for the wrong order they would be getting five stars .
BUYER BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I ORDERED PARTS TWICE FROM PART GEEK AND FIRST TIME THEY SENT ME A PART THAT WAS BROKE .
I DONE EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO TO SEND IT BACK .
THEN THEY REFUSED IT AND I HAVE NOT SEEN IT OR ANY REASON WHY .
SO I GAVE THEM THE BENIFIT OF THE DOUT AND ORDERED SOMETHING ELSE FROM THEM ONLY TO GET A WRONG PART TIS TIME .
I AM OUT OVER $ 380.00 SO FAR WITH NO HOPE OF GETTING AN ANSWER .
SO DO NOT BUY ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE WITH YHIS CO .
I HOPE YOU GET BETTER SERVICE THAN I DID

B&H is one of the best -- if not THE best -- online retailers .
B&H carries the widest selection of the best products at the best prices .

I wish the rest of my dealings were as easy and successful .
I think that your site is awesome and we look forward to staying at the Aztec Hotel in Seaside Heights in June
We are looking forward to having a leasure 4 days at the Aztec Hotel in Seaside Heights at the New Jersey shore .
I have stayed at the Aztec before with my former spouse , but after she passed away , I met a lovely women named Shelly and we got married in July , 1988 and we have been happily married ever since .
I want to show her the wonderful experience that I had at the Aztec Motel and I am sure that she will just love it !

Great competence of sales people .

Very helpful and knowledgable .
They RUINED my WEDDING !!
They charged my Fiance 's credit card for the same booking TWICE a week ago !!
He called his bank and had Bookit fax over the reservation so he could get a refund asap but his Bank said after 2 days when they finally did recieve the fax from Bookit there was some third-party company working with Bookit who charged his card directly .
So his bank said to call them ... when he did he was on hold another hour & they claimed they didn't see the charge so he had to call Bookit again and be on hold for another hour just to be told he won't see his refund 7-10 business days !!
This is their mistake and now my entire family has to pay for it !!!
That was his money and we needed it for our WEDDING !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am SO UPSET !!!!!!!!!
NEVER BOOK WITH THEM THEY WILL SCAM YOU ANY CHANCE THEY GET !!
THEY BANK OFF INTEREST FROM MONEY THEY STEAL FROM YOU AND USE THIRD PARTY COMPANIES TO TRIP UP YOUR BANK SO YOU CAN'T EVEN GET A REFUND FROM YOUR BANK !!!
CRUSTY BUSINESS !!!!!
WORST EVER !
On time and wonderful product !
Using Pinnacle Promotions was wonderful .
They made suggestions to our ordered product , made the change and still got us our product on time .
We would use them again for any promotional items we need .
It was pleasure working with such a professional company and cared that we were satisfied !
Very , informative .
Tour was relaxing and the weather was cooperative , yet I felt if it was just possible to pull up to one of the many show stopper 's such as the children library , or Chinese restaurant to have a meal or just to look would have been the Ultimate tour .
I got my order on time and I believe Express Medical supply was the cheapest so far .." That is from what I was buying ".
I'llsure come back !
I have used Bookbyte many times , without any issues !
I would recommend the site to anyone , as well as use it again , myself .
Once I decided to purchase your website was very smooth to navigate and purchasing was a breeze .
Straight forward , simple , easy .
The product was pictured correctly .
I got what I saw .
It was easy to set up the order and complete .
It arrived a day or two early in a well packed clearly marked box .
Honestly I couldn't have asked for more .
Good , but expensive , 20% admin fee much too high
Very fast service , response within minutes day or night , but you pay for this service with a very steep admin charge , on last purchase over 20% additional charge
Used many times and always good , great prices too .
Top class , always good to deal with , many thanks .
very good service
prompt and trouble free transaction thank you
great quality product
Can only say how pleased i am , first class product and great price would buy again .

You can easily search thousands of items and purchase in a flash .
EXCELLENT QUALITY AND PRICING !
I was thrilled to learn of you from a friend who thoroughly studies each vitamin site before purchasing online .
The quality of everything I purchased is top notch .
I'd refer you in a heartbeat .
I purchased red maca and cacao powder , goji berries and sundried goji berries .
Everything was just as stated , quality to me is most important , then pricing .
I felt your pricing is fair and reasonable and didn't break the bank .
First4magnets - first for service
I thoroughly recommend this company .
Before placing my order I raised a query which was answered fully and quickly .
A subsequent question was answered equally fully and quickly .
As a result I was able to ensure I ordered the right product for my needs and the goods arrived very quickly - beautifully packaged .
honest , helpful , courteous , fast service .
that is the only place I go to .
Not like the real deal
The ink came in a timely manner .
I put the cart ledges in my printer and one leaked .
I will never order placebo ink again .
HotToner is a reliable supplier of ink cartridges .
I have twice purchased ink cartridges from HotToner for my C7180 HP printer and they have delivered within 48 hours .
It is worth pointing out however that a Cyan cartrdge that I purchased last week resulted in a message on my printer saying " ink cartridge is out of date ".
I pressed the OK button and the printer has been working normally .
Fingers crossed .
The design process was very easy .
The quality of the shirts were fabulous .
The shipping was super fast .
My first order but will definitely use Shima Uma again
This was the first time I had come across Shima Uma and the price for the ink cartridges was one of the lowest .
I ordered over a weekend but the order was processed and despatched on the Sunday and arrived Tuesday - the earliest it could have for the delivery I chose .
I had e-mails to keep me informed and the delivery was in the time window I was told .
I will definitely use Shima Uma again .
Easiest Car Purchase Ever
I would highly recommend this type of car purchase .
Fast , friendly , professional , no pressure .
Selected car on-line , approved and out the door in no time .
Everyone was interested in helping me and making sure that I was satisfied with car and terms of purchase .
Best thing I ever did
Easy to order , quick shipment , timely communication .
Loved the T-Shirt !
Very unusual and is a constant reminder of my kitty .
Very good prices for great products
The products i got was very cheap compared to other places I have looked for it ( even Amazon had it more expensive !
Very efficient service and very accommodating service !
If you need a renewal of your passport quickly - this is the place to use .
Very good customer service - they walk you through everything !
It is a bit pricey - hence the 4 stars - but , you def get your passport in a rush !
The handle is too short and I do not like the way you need to load a blade .
Why Drivers dont get to you - a customers view
Whilst the language in the ' Why Drivers dont get to you ' opinion might not be eloquent , the detail is very understandable .
I speak as an industrial customer of City Link and it is because of the drivers that we stay loyal to the company .
The drivers are - generally - splendid and helpful .
They try their best in all weathers and with some very hard to find locations .
They are not highly paid and there is a high turnover of staff for all sorts of reasons - some get better jobs , some - well just drift off .
They drive lumpy great big vans unsuitable for narrow suburban roads or country lanes .
They do have all the pressure of demanding fincially focused ( !
) management and domestic delivery users that are both demanding and not always understanding .
The system of carriers was never designed to cope with the rapid increase in domestic internet shopping .
It will change and I am sure there will be some ' No Carrier Service ' postcode zones comming to a location nearby soon .
Fine products and an easy company to buy from .
Too easy to buy some delightful products from .
No idea how they treat returns - never had to even think about doing so .
Thank you for a wonderful service .
An amazing service .
Thank you .
The arrangement I ordered truly fit the occasion-gorgeous !
I was very pleased with your service , also in placing my order .
The beautiful flowers and special sympathy card arrived on time and were prettier than the picture !
Customer service could not be better !
The website was user friendly .
I received hassle free delivery , and there customer service reps were extremely helpful and knowledgeable .
I will recommend and be using ecomfort for all heating and cooling projects .
greaty products , great service !!
Just received the wedding thank you cards and they are simply perfect !
5 Stars !
Outstanding customer service !
High quality clothing , fast service , a perfect fit and all at a very reasonable price !
I ordered a power plate on friday , it states next day delivery , thinking it would arrive yesterday i waited around .
Hopefully it will come today !
Used Blackcircles a few times now and have never failed to impress .
Will continue to use Blackcircles for all my tyre needs and would be happy to recommend to friends & family .
Helpful advice , professional service
Great advice from John and Jeff , very professional service and a lovely guitar with a perfect set-up delivered to France within 3 days-I couldn't rate the experience any more highly .
Great service , Perfect part , definately would buy from PartsGeek again !
Quick shipping , received a few days after the purchase .
I was informed via email at each stage from purchase , to processing , to shipping .
The part was an exact match and name brand .
Buying from PartsGeek saved me $50 purchasing from them instead of the local parts store .
I would definitely buy from them again and would have no problem recommending them to a friend .
Great prices ; confusing website .
I wish the website had a decent search feature , and that it didn't load all of the pictures one-at-a-time when browsing large categories .
It was nearly impossible for me to find what I was looking for because the page kept jumping around while the pictures were loading .
its been a long time since I have had service like this , the part was the right one , the price was incredible , and I had the part in two days
value for money and good service
very strong brench and very pleased and the price was good
I would recommend this company to my friends
Customer service resolved fault quickly .
Haveing purchased a Zannussi built in single oven and hade it installed by an electriton , we found there to be a fault on the led clock .
After a few calls to customer services this was dealt with very profesionaly and to my satifaction would recommend .
fast service , quality product .
will definately use again
have not yet used my highchair as my baby is not old enough yet but i have put it up and cant wait to use it
best internet nutrition site by far
fantastic deals and easy to use site .
i really liked being able to choose my day of delivery , it made things allot easier .
Got the correct parts i ordered , was happy and pleased with that .
The box the parts came in was very beat up and some tape was torn off .
On inspection of the merchandise , there was a little ear piece of the grill broken off and it was inside the wrapping of the grill .
Was glad the grill still attached even with that piece missing .
Paid extra for the insurance , but couldnt contact partsgeek by telephone .
Overall pleased with the price and parts , just a couple of things not happy with .
Games come on time , quick response to your queries !
The games come , no worries , they are reputable .
Also , they responded quickly to my queries .
YesStyle is perfect !
I'm a regular shopper of YesStyle and I am very satisfied with everything .
The clothes offered on YesStyle are not like the ones in my country ; they have much more variety and are much cuter .
All of the clothes are high quality and are worth every penny .
I highly recommend YesStyle !
Cheap prices and quick delivery :)
Forget the rest , these guys are the best .
Everything from their web page was simple and fast , including the delivery on time .
could not have been better .
The right way to do business .
Very good and professional company .
Used them for booking of Santorini and Crete .
Very quickly and efficiently help solve all problems .
100% First class
You are great , guys !
Wonderful experience .
They are always ready to help you .
So easy and had what I wanted in stock
I wanted to send a thank you goft to a friend of the new Honey Jack Daniels and you had it in stock to be able to send the next day .
Thrilled with the ease of use and delivery was quick .
Received product on time and it was as specified
Ordering took a few minutes .
But it was time well spent .
The graphic arrived on time and it was exactly as described .
Would order from them again without concern .
Expected it to be a bit more heavy/thick but otherwise , I am fine with it
Do not have a full review other than what I stated in my one sentence review .
Happy with the service and delivery , expected it to be heavier and thicker .
Otherwise , satisfied .
My husband drove 40 minutes one way to the location to sign the contract because I was told the facility was only open every other day .
When he got there the facility didn't have the confirmation that he showed them on his phone and didn't even have storage available .
He then drove back .
He basically wasted 1.5 hours of his day because Sparefoot didn't bother to check with the facility .
Prompt delivery , product exactly as expected !
Ordered a hockey stick for my Son for Christmas .
Well structured website with very good buying guidance notes .
Ordering and payment very smooth .
Product delivered on expected date .
Product fine , but packaging was minimal and slightly damaged , so potential risk that Barrington may want to consider .
However , overall very good and hoping present is a hit at Christmas !
Great value , excellent service , a website that works
Using BoilerJuice is great for the following reasons :
The website is easy to use
They are great on price
The delivery was earlier than the guaranteed date
They pass on savings for group orders
You can save towards your next order in a simple way
You can manage your account online through their user friendly website
Thoroughly recommended !
LENSTORE ARE NO 1
I recommend Lestore , I been using their lenses for a couple of years now and have never had a problem .
They always deliver super quick even when I've order late at night or over the weekend they come within two days .
Great service .
great products , delivered quickly .
good customer service
I ordered a pair of converse trainers , was kept up to speed with order progress and delivery was hassle free .
They are too big and I am sending them back , this too is easy to do .
I hope to get the size smaller soon .
excellent service , advice , delivery and great product .
From the advice on which table to choose to the delivery at a time convenient to me the service from this company has been excellent .
The table is great , had some good family games already , definitely recommend .
Great service & fast delivery
I ordered a couple of items within a week of each other , larger item was sent by courier , the delivery date was not suitable but I was able to change it immediately via the notification e-mail saving a failed delivery .
After delivery I phoned about a breakage on one of the items , a replacement part was despatched the same day , no argument .
Brilliant service , thanks .
All parts ordered arriver fine and were installed within 24 hours .
The part ordered arrived on time and I installed them with no problem .
I used the diagrams and ordered the parts needed by the view in the catalog and had no problems installing the part fit perfictly .
I love ami they have all sorts of different clothes and shoes to choose from I will be going shopping some more .
The service and the labels excellent !
It 's always very scary ordering something on line but customer service made this happen without any hiccups , labels arrived earlier than expected and it was perfect :) !
This will be the third Nikon DSLR that I have purchased from B&H .
Other members of my family have purchased cameras and lenses from B&H .
Every experience we have had has been very satisfactory .
Last summer ( 2013) , we had the pleasure to actually visit B&H in New York .
I can't think of another camera dealer that I'd rather do business with .
Ultimate resource to find your favorite opticals ..
Still expensive though
Product authentic ..
Shipping is quick .
You get what you want .
Awesome sauce !
I use Goldstar frequently to purchase discounted tickets to shows in my area .
I haven't been disappointed yet .
Great , swift service .
Never had an issue with Shopto . net and will always purchase from them rather than retail or anywhere else via online .
Though they don't encourage obtaining games before release they do send pre-ordered games out in plenty of time to avoid disappointment on release date .
This has more often than not meant I have a new release a couple of days earlier than if I went and bought it from a shop .
Shopto . net seem cheaper than most other sellers and are usually on par for price on the rare occasion they are not cheaper .
I like the loyalty scheme too .
Companies like Shopto . net shine amongst others in their industry and I have no worries about GAME stores or Gamestation going bust when companies like Shopto out class them consistently .
Easy to find product and order
Right product delivered without problems

Made Buying Doge SUPER EASY
I was extremely hesitant to place an order because it all seemed so complicated but it was very straight forward .
I placed an order , got a confirmation email and then the coins appeared in my wallet .
Will definitely be buying more !
the job was perfect
I was looking for a quick service to translate my birth certificate with a certification .
This site gave me a quick and professional service in less than 24 hours .
The job was well done and i'm a very satisfy customer .
I highly recommend this site .
Simple Process , Cheap Price and Reliable .
The site has a simple process to book the hotels , I think the other site has some complicated process .
For example , I saw the price $70 for one room , but when I clicked the booking the price changed to $100 due to service fee or something ...
I'm traveler from Korea so I'm not good in English and booking American hotel in online ...
BUT The HostelBookers . com has a simple process .
If the price is $70 , that price keep $70 , does not changed :D I don't need to be confused .
And The HostelBookers . com has the most Cheap Price as I searched online .
Had the home visit to change tires , very handy good service
First class service
I almost couldn't believe that a garment ordered no more than three days earlier arrived at my door on the west coast of the US so quickly .
A great company with which to do business .
helpful and friendly
Helpful and friendly , explained differences between tires , didn't try to sell me what I didn't want , and yet recommended a better alignment which I needed .
O so easy
Well seeing that I am not great at patients I have found the site so easy to use .
We are touring Europe in a couple of months and were looking for places to stay .
The best part of the site was that not only was there great detail on the accomodation but the reviews of former visitors made it even easier to pick a place .
I am not the best when it comes to technology but with all relevant info like the maps , things to do or sightseeing info was a great help for me .
I would recommend this site to all .
great site .
I Would like to receive the parts that I purchased on 1/14/14 tired of waitng for them !
I would Sure like to receive the part I ordered in a more timely manner !
You sure didn't wait to take the money out of my account .
I am very dissatisfied right now .
Still waiting on my cards ...... :(
Ordered 3 gift cards the day I found out about Giftcards . com , which was 12/12/13 .
As of 12/27/13 , still don't have them .......... Sure hope they get here by 12/31/13 !
Customer service did a great job of going to their team leader , but I am still waiting for cards .
Well very in prest with kwik fit serves the fitter was helpfull on the phone to me when he was comeing to fill the tryes on the day can not find fualt with him at all and he was very polight on the phone
I ordered a bass drum skin with Gak online as I had absolutely no time to go to a music shop , at 4.30 pm Wedesday evening .
By 2.00 pm the next day , of was safely in my house .
I cannot thank you guys enough .
Truly awful !
Ordered a Christmas present - I was sent the wrong item - returned it - the same wrong item came back - third time I received the right item - in January when it was on sale - and no refund for the return postage !
Won't use them again .
Speedy , Reliable and great value !
Couldn't look for a better service than discount supplements provide , package arrived the next day with two free gifts inside and I even got a text from the courier with a 2 hour window in which they would be delivering .
They also gave me a 5% off code for my next order !
Easy , convenient , great value wouldn't dream of shopping anywhere else .
No worries parking and collection
It was the easiest airport drop off and return i have ever experienced with my car - no queues , a helping hand , friendly and efficient service and sparkling car handed back within two minutes of leaving the terminal .
And ten days parking cost less than a taxi both ways .
The future for me is stress free parking .
NEVER LIED TO ME !!!!
Being a woman it 's hard trying to find a honest mechanic and a part store .
I had such an awful time trying to get the right part to fix my 98 QX4 Infiniti .
First , I called Infiniti dealership regarding the parts and they wanted $ 298.00 for one lower trailing arm .
Thank GOD , I went to Partsgeek and got the exact same part for $ 47.00 .
As a woman , I will always go to Partsgeek first (# 1 ) source for us women .
Extremely satisfied and my SUV runs good :)
Auto Ship is a tremendous program !
We have found that our dog is much happier and healthier when eating Blue Buffalo food .
There is not a store within a 30 minute drive that stocks Blue Buffalo .
We were so pleased to find the PetFlow will auto ship our preferred dog food and has flexibility built in should our needs change as to amount and freqency .
The price is competitive and the service is unsurpassed .
Thank you PetFlow
I like it ...
Very simple and easy to use ... only draw back is shipping is little bit slow but other wise i like the site very much .
Great selection and options available with very good prices as well ...
Found exactly what I was looking for .
I wanted to make a photo book for my sons forthcoming 40th Birthday .
I did just that , I will recommend to my friends and family .
Great customer support
I bought my second set of classes and was having trouble viewing them .
I started a chat and Nikki did a great job walking me through the process ( it was easy) .
I made an error when booking .
So once confirmed I opened an issue ticket and within 12 hours I had a reply and confirmed that they had amended the error for me .
Will definitely use SkyTours again , thanks
Always on time and reliable !
Dependable and as always great costomer service
Fast and Trustworthy
Every time I make a purchase I know I will get it on a reliable basis .
very nice very good
GREAT FREE SHIPPING !
The window regulator was OEM and received it in one day , easy to installed and is working great .
Best price on the internet !
After much research Book-it had the lowest prices for vacations .
They also provided a payment plan .
Beautifull flower but very bad delivery
The flower where beautifull but the delivery guys was 2hours late and talk very bad to my girlfriend because he didn't know how to read a map .
Wonderful company to work with !
I have now ordered two times from this company for my contacts .
The fastest delivery I've ever had , the best service possible , and very , very affordable !
I will never buy my contacts from the eye doctor again .
These same contacts , for a six month supply through my doctor as close to $200 .
with OptiContacts the same contacts were under $60 .
Highly recommend !
A very good car for a good price .
We picked out the car we wanted and they provided a car that was as good if not better .
Not a problem all of the way through .
They had a special offer for a GPS and that was a God Send for us .
We found all of the special places we want to go with out the problems of asking directions in a language we don't understand .
Great product !
Fast delivery !
I loved the product !
Cheap and great quality !
I received my package fast and in great condition !
Service All Messed Up Now
Over a month we are not getting calls/texts/ and voice mail errors out .
Called customer service , they gave us a $15 credit on an over $200 per month account .
We visited the local store all they do is reset phone and profile and say sorry it will probably be fixed in a week , 2 weeks , a month as we update to Spark .
Meanwhile I cant get calls should my kids be sick/hurt etc when I am working .
Cant communicate with family , clients etc .
This is BULL .
This is also a breech of contract , I paid to have a phone service for my family .. and I am not able to use the service as they advertised .
Removed Our Customers Reviews
We worked hard to send out email invitations for our customers past and present to leave reviews about their experience with us .
TrustPilot then called us to sign up for their paid service and we declined because we used another review company at the present .
1 week later .. the handful of reviews we had on TrustPilot were all taken down .
Very disappointing .
Expect OK From Most Sellers
There are good folks and bad folks on Fiverr because it is a marketplace .
Generally speaking you get OK results , sometimes the results kinda suck , and sometimes you get AMAZING results and it sometimes takes trial and error if you are looking for a specific service like a video to find the right " voice " and quality .
Amazon Prime is a Must-Have
I am in love with all the free movies and shows you get as an Amazon Prime customer in addition to the shipping savings .
I have had a couple issues with their customer service but in all not enough to be terribly upsetting .
Love My Barnes and Noble
Seriously coffee and books .. what is not to love ?
The prices vary but are generally fair and so far I have never had a major issue with online or in store purchases .
I really liked using Indeed since it grabs jobs from lots of different places and you can sort by date , positions etc .
My only gripe was not really their fault , since it 's a job aggregate if the companies listing online have auto-renewal for listings it will say a job is new when it is actually just a re-posted one ... but again that is not Indeed doing it .
Best rates around !
Great traveling experience @ a great rate !
An easy and accessible online store .
The options where clear and easy to use , I found the item I was looking for straight away and made use of the student discount .
I would recommend this store to anyone .
Excellent service all round .
Clear and easy to use online store , offering discounted sale items and the latest clothing available .
Postage was excellent , quick and effortless .
I fully recommend using this store .
watch your credit card
I ordered two pieces for a halloween party in sept . 3 weeks later I called about my order and was assured it would be here by or on the 31st .
With Halloween being on a Monday I explained that the costume was for parties and not trick or treating and I ordered early enough not to have to worry .
I was told one piece was on back order and would be sent out as soon as it came in .
One week before Halloween , I emailed ami that I no longer wanted the order .
3 days later they replied that i piece was shipped and the other piece was refunded .
When I received the one piece in the mail ( on the 31st ) it was nothing like the picture .
So I used their return label and sent it back to them .
In mid Nov .
I got it back with a standard form as to why they would not except the return .
The form had several reasons listed , but none were checked .
Instead they hand wrote at the bottom that I didn't have some sort of return # that is required ???
After several emails and 3 phone calls I finally spoke with a manager .
Just to be blown off and told I was not getting my money back .
Thats when I disputed the charge with my credit card .
After explaining everything to my credit card company .
They agreed to dispute the charge .
Mid Dec . the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized , or so I thought .
The rest you can call coincidence if you want but on Christmas Eve , less then 2 weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim eI used my card since Sept , my card was declined for a purchase .
When I called they told my there were some questionable online charges that same day that were not mine , so they voided my card and are sending me a new card with a new number .
Since I rarely use that card it was easy to who might have had access to my information .
Of course I can't prove who did it and the attempted charges totaled less then 22 dollars , it seems like a feeble attempt done just to mess with me .
I am also very confident that this review will get a response from ami a lot faster then any of my complaints that went directly to them .
Unacceptable lack of service to Americans serving overseas .
Your unwillingness to ship to the US Postal systems APO and FPO addresses shows either breathtaking amount of ignorance or is a willful slap in the face to American service members serving overseas .
You have embittered a customer .
Items ordered were shipped promptly and all items ordered were received well packaged .
I would order from this vendor again .
Best service outside Germany .
Well done !
The Best !!!
I have bought many Photon Lights and I just can't say enough good about them .
They are far and away the best lights I've ever used .
I use them in my survival kits .
Trust your life to them .
Very Happy with the serviced received , the order was fullfill on time and very pleased witht the products that we ordered
Great Service , great price .
I ordered a thermostat from Ingram's.
It arrived quickly and undamaged .
I would not hesitate to order from Ingram 's anytime I needed a product .
Perfect - easy , quick and reliable
I really enjoyed the service provided .
The goods were delivered to my Singapore address so quickly and the goods were in excellent condition - in fact they looked better than in the internet .
So thank you !
was a bit unsure about ordering as i dint know any who had used this website before . have used it twice now . its cheap , easy to use and keep you well informed .
Pretty reliable .
I haven't used their full services , but only go on PC Game Supply to buy Karma Koin when I need it -- and they hold true to their word .
I'm very skeptical of buying game cards online , so I Google'd around to see if people had bought from them .
Turns out some people bought cards from them , and didn't get scammed .
Gave it a try , and I got my codes from them after a good 2-3 minutes from purchasing .
My Assos Review
The exchange was pleasant and a good one .
I love Assos clothes .
I wish you had more deals on all your clothes .
Too many items out of stock .
Need lenses ?
Get them here !
This was a re-order , which I needed urgently .
The lenses were in stock , at the right price and arrived before the estimated delivery date in superb packaging .
SERVICE WITH FLAIR
I am extremely happy with the service and method of payment .
It is great to know that there is now somewhere to discard used phones and make some money back at the same time .
I hope you will be around for a long time .
I have told others about your service .
Thank you .
Fast to send payment out and good to do business with .
Fast to get payment to me .
Good prices for phones .
Well instructed to how to post phones .
Now that was a speedy service
I ordered the telescopic magnet grab .
My son has lost a screw in his bikes headlight !
Ordered on the 1st of november delivered on the second , now that is impresive since I live in a very rural area .
Product as described .
Very useful , easy and informative site for when you are on the move
I am on a rtw trip of a lifetime and I use Hostelworld to make 99% of my hostel reservations .
It 's idiot proof really !
And there apple and android apps make it even easier to use on the move .
The only negative I would say is that they don't always show a hostels full availability so if there is somewhere in particular you want to stay check with the hostel directly before moving on .
very promt service and cheaper than oringinal quote !
Very promt service and cheaper than oringinal quote !
Great products and easy to buy !
Great products and easy to buy !
Amazing company : they have what I want and at a good price .
My first MCM order was for an item I found at MCM that had gone out of stock at another online store .
The price was as good or better at MCM .
After that , I started receiving catalogs and have placed many orders .
They have never let me down .
I had an emergency order that they jumped through hoops to get done and shipped for a photoshoot , will use them again in a heartbeat .
Great website .
Very quick delivery
My first time ordering shaving equipment on line .
Very pleased with the service .
Shipped on Saturday and my package arrived on Monday .
And that was across country .
I will do business with these folks again .
Also the razor I ordered is what I expected .
Very happy .
Wonderful Product !!!
Hodges has outdone themselves .
The ribbons are beautiful .
I cannot say Thank You enough for doing a wonderful job !
Treated well , exactly as advertised , just more expensive than I would have liked .
Treated well , exactly as advertised , just more expensive than I would have liked .
Best experience ever ordering tshirts !
Not only did you deliver us great tshirts overnight - your staff bent over backwards to help us convert our artwork that looked great and saved us money .
Can't speak highly enough about your staff , the printing and the quality of the shirts we order from you .
You make us look good for our customers - and we can't thank you enough !

Hunger Games™ Unofficial Fan Tours
Order met expectations !
We have received the pads and are just now going to use them .
My niece is home from the hospital and my sister says they are very nice .
Really easy to use service
Great rates and easy to use service .
I will use them again .
Hassle free and great value parking at Heathrow !
Booked online and saved 20% with a company link .
The meet and greet were flexible with the pre-arranged times .
No problems here .
Good value for money , delivery experience could be improved
Very good value for the item I purchased ( Neff gas hob) .
However I had to contact Electricshop twice to get a date for the delivery as no one made contact with me prior , even after several days of placing the order .
Not impressed of the costumer service .
There is no email available to communicate with the customer service .
When I tried to submit return ticket the website says that this option is not available at the moment .??
Basically I have to keep the damaged part and wait until they fix the website .
Will not use them again unless they save me the time to ship back something that came already damaged ...
fabulous with reasonable prices
Cant stop looking every other day !
The staff helped me to find a solution for an obsolete item which then gave that old item a new lease of life .
STEER CLEAR , Hazardous to health !
My first order arrived with a pack of chicken split open .
The rest of the order ( some suppliments ) was all covered in blood !
I emailed to let them know and was offered a free chicken , but I still had to place a minimum order of £10 and pay £ 4.95 delivery !
The rest of my order arrived chilled not frozen , with instructions saying the meat was fresh so freeze on the day of delivery , BUT when I emailed to check on the use by dates I was informed that the meat had previously been frozen and DO NOT RE FREEZE , this is after I have frozen mine as per the previous instruction !
I sent another email asking what I could do now that it has been frozen , guess what - SILENCE !!
You guessed it , no reply so basically you are on your own if you need any food safety advice !
Take my advice , buy fresh meat from your local butcher , at least you know the history of your food , and there is somebody who will answer your questions !
Save lots by buying in bulk !
Internet service at its best .
A brilliant service , really quick and a great price
Ordered a spinning bike for my husband , had a problem with a faulty part , customers services were excellent and sent out a replacement part very quickly , would recommend .
super fast delivery
Great way to get game card fast
The best prices in one click !!
We found it a very pleasant experience , working for the first time with your site !
The card in which every hotel can be located next to the most interesting monuments made our choice easier .
We also liked the amount of pictures of each hotel .
The ratings of other customers and visiters of the hotels were also very enriching during our search !
Less pleasant was when we decided to book and pay ; we noticed that de original price didn't include the taxes ( 10% TAV) .
Because we didn't find this hotel any cheaper elsewere , we decided tot book anyway .
Eventhough , we would recommend to be more open to your clients , including all taxes to the prices mentioned ...
I hope this will help you to make your site even better ;-)
Kind regards ,
Blue Buffalo Dog Food Shipped to your Door at a Great Price .
Was looking for a ( Deal ) on Blue Buffalo on Ebay without buying from fraudulent Scammers .
Did a Internet Search and found PetFlow and got a Great Price with quick Delivery .
Hope they stay competitive and will purchase from them again .
Low Price and shipping right to your Door works for me !
Unbelievable quality and service
Whilst packing for my holiday I realised my snorkel equipment was in desperate need of renewal .
I ordered on the Friday , received delivery first thing Monday morning and was able to fly that night with superb new equipment .
On the Tuesday I was diving in the Red Sea and I was so thankful I had found this wonderful website .
Cant wait for a chance to use Simply Scuba again .

I love B&H because that ship is fast and most time free
Great futon , great price
Ordered at the Los Altos store in the morning , picked up at the San Jose store after work .
Great service , great price , great product .
Best price and fast service !
Really easy website .
Consistently good pricing and I had done my research !
Ordered and here VERY quickly indeed .
I would recommend readily and will use again .
Value for money AND efficiency !
Heard about this on a morning TV programme .
Located the site easily .
Navigated it uneventfully and ordered my hay fever pills within minutes !
Just the part I needed , quickly delivered !
Was looking for a replacement part for my car and found just what I was looking for here at partgeek ...... ordered it and got it within days ...... very satisfied !
What I need in my life !
So one magical day my friend told me where I can find absolutely adorable clothes without having to sell my soul to buy them .
I looked Yesstyle . com up and fell in love with the quirky fashion .
The website was very easy to navigate through and everything looked very legit .
I cant wait till I get my new pullover !
Horrid Customer Service , Will Never Use Them Again
We booked a trip months ago for a trip in a few weeks , and upon checking to make sure we still have our seating assignments ( they screwed it up last year too) , we found that we no longer had any seating assignments .
Mind you , we're travelling with a minor .
So I called Expedia to find out what happened and they said seating assignments are not guaranteed .
So I asked : Then why do you allow people to choose them ?
No answer .
She suggested I call the airline .
So I did .
Airline rep told me Expedia cancelled ( yes cancelled ) our seat assignments when they had a schedule change , which we were never notified of .
She said they aren't supposed to do that .
So , our seats were given away and now the flight is booked .
Angry , I called Expedia back to talk to a supervisor who kept talking over me , and subsequently hung up on me .
So I called corporate in Washington .
Go ahead , try it .
You hit 0 to be connected to an operator and will be sitting with a ringing phone forever .
I held out 10 minutes just to see how long it would be .
Never an answer .
Called back twice , same thing .
Next , I emailed and left a message for their SVP Operations ( found his info online) .
No call back , no email back .
I am at a loss .
I have used Expedia for years , and will NEVER use them again .
They are a horrible company with NO customer service at all .
I hope they go down , badly .
They deserve it .
Great quality , no sales tax , vast selection , organized site -- SOLD !
I absolutely love YesStyle .
Everything about this site is pleasing , from the selection and quality of the clothes , to the organized and easy-to-use website .
I can browse for exactly what I need when I need it and even usually get a great deal or find something on sale that ships super quickly , or I can shop around and find something I absolutely love for a great price .
I can't get enough of this site !
Good Prices .
Fast Delivery .
No Problems .
My purchase went well with no issues .
The hotel people were OK but the room was BAD . Dirty run down too many stairs to climb .
I wood never go back to this hotel .
What a buncha ' geeks !
Well , as they named themselves , they ARE some geeks .
Let me tell you , they are some good geeks , at that !
I had ordered a headlight for an ' 09 Ford E150 .
I'm not certain it was OEM , but it may as well have been .
The thing matches wonderfully , and is extremely sturdy .
I was Grade-A packed-and-shipped , too .
Really , I'll be looking to Parts Geek from now on when I need to order something when things go wrong for me again .
Ordered at 12.30 pm on Thursday , everything was processed and dispatched within a couple of hours , and it arrived on the Friday .
Fast , efficient , no fuss service .
I was very impressed .
Very good service
The very best to deal with
ALL GOOD !
Very simple transaction and arrived promptly and as described .
Would do business with them again .
No reservations !
Their service was professional , prompt and thorough .
Our order turned out exactly as we hoped it would , at lower price than we quoted elsewhere
Loved my coasters .
They were a hit !
I am happy to write a review but I resent having to fill in blanks where I don't want to .
The site won't let me post until I fill this box in .
Please refer to my favorable review above
Excellence all around .
This company hit all the marks .
Took my ideas and made them real , exactly what I was looking for .
Would highly recommend them for creating your next logo .
The communication and quickness in completing each task was very fast .
Making the whole process a great experience .
I am very satisfied of workmanship , front end alignment and services .
Will be back again
Friendly , excellent !
Great booking system and really helpful .
Very clear showing of price in various currency .
Vast choice and very easy payment .
Clearly recommended for hostel and guesthouse booking .
FYI I book a guesthouse in Seoul in a few minutes .
incorrect passenger info .... AAARRRGGHHH
I have booked flights for my entire family which was a total of 15 passengers only 2 days ago for us all to travel from Dublin to Orlando and initially found eBookers the only company who were happy to deal with a group without having to wait 48 hours whilst they checked with airlines etc .
The agent I spoke to was very pleasant and very clear when recapping everything , although he did state that the system they use was having problems a number of times which didnt fill me with confidence when spending so much on flights for so many .
After a lengthy call to get all the details and another shorter 1 to book the flights all was apparently sorted and correct .
However even though the agent had read out all full names phonetically and date of births to confirm I still found on the confirmation email that he had got the middle name and date of birth of my brother in law incorrect .
I have called again yesterday to have this corrected by eBookers who promised to action this but after a few hours of checking online I could see no change so I contacted them again via Live chat on their website and this Agent had no record of my previous call .
They have confirmed the corrections have been made and sent to airlines and TSA but I cannot see this as will take their systems 48 to 72 hours to update ( begs the question how old is their comuter system) .
So after all of this the airline has sent confirmation now still showing the incorrect info and I can see this turning into a Monster .
This wont put me off using them in future ( if they get this sorted obviously !
) as I can see how an error can be made but they should have a much better system in place for correcting their own errors and resending confirmation to their customers to show this .
All I want is confirmation that all is correct so I can relax !!!!!
Fast , accurate and WAY below dealer cost !
Shipped in two business days , less than 1/3 what I would have paid for a new wheel at the Mazda dealer .
great service was arrived exactly as described .
Would not hesitate to use them again .
A great place to park your car .
Easy website to navigate and find the best parking .
Easy shop but slowwww delivery
It was easy to navigate the shop and find good deals but it took weeks for two books to show up to my address .
If I had ordered a day or two later it would have messed up a lot of events
It was easy to use SpareFoot .
I was searching for a storage unit and it appeared high in Googles Search .
Click click click and I found LifeStorage .
Best experience I have had in searching for storage .
Then LifeStorage exceeded my expectations !
very un- amazing ......
I placed two orders with pure formulas .
The shipping was fast and the orders arrived together .
That 's the only good thing I have to say
I ordered the raw cashews and they were not up to par .
I don't even believe they were raw .
They had a definite " taste " to them , almost like the faint taste of some kind of grease or animal oil , and I couldn't eat the rest of them .
I was so disappointed that I didn't open my second package and had it sent back immediately .
- I eat a raw organic vegan diet and ordered from Pure Formulas because I thought I had found an incredible deal ..... you can't find raw cashews for this low anywhere else , and now I see why .
I have eaten raw cashews for years , sourced from many places , and never have I tasted any as suspect as these were .
I was disappointed and will go back to paying 3x 's the amount for cashews that actually are raw .
I purchased rebuilt brake calipers with brake pads , a rotor , and a parking brake cable in two different transactions .
The rebuilt calipers were rebuilt beautifully .
They were cheap , and just like brand new .
I received my parts quickly , and they were exactly as advertised .
I sent back my old calipers and received my core credit promptly , with no hassle whatsoever .
This is the second time I have done a brake job on a vehicle using parts geek for buying remanufactured brake calipers .
Both times , the calipers were the right ones , they were remanufactured very nicely , and there was no trouble at all with getting my core charge back ( follow the clear instructions on getting your core charge back) .
I received tracking info for my purchases , and everything I have ordered has been right .
I have been satisfied with parts geeks service every time , and their pricing has been impossible to beat .
thanks boilerjuice recieved oil day after i ordered , recommending to neighbours , thanks once again
The best of the best !
Everything was just perfect !
It 's a no brainer really .
The easiest , most convenient site for ordering contact lenses .
I don't even think/worry about it anymore .
Good service is transparent - and lenstore.co.uk is crystal clear .
I have shopped here for many years and have always been satisfied with my products and great service ...!!
One-stop shop !
Amazing selection , speedy delivery , Live Chat is a great feature
Honest Advisor , Accomodating & Trustworthy Company
Very professional and took there time to explain various plans at length and answer ANY question I had concerning my future income ...

AEC Radnor is the absolute best !
American Executive Center Radnor Office continues to be perfect for my business .
The staff is very good at managing my calls , voice mail , and physical mail/deliveries .

Great service and problem solving

Rapide et sérieux
J'ai commandé une selle Italia en chronopost avec livraison sur mon lieu de travail .
J'ai fait une fausse manip en commandant et c'est mon adresse du domicile qui a été pris en compte .
Le suivi par Alltricks a été très sérieux , jusqu'à la livraison .
Tout s'est arrangé comme il fallait .
Merci encore !
Good prices , quick , reliable and comprehensive .
I found a pair of Salomon shoes at a very good price and ordered them at Millet Sports .
The day afterwards I noticed I had made a mistake and had picked the wrong model .
I e-mailed them about it .
The next day they replied that it was ok to change for another model Salomon shoes , at the same price .
It really arranged me .
The shipping was also very fast .
I'm very satisfied with this company and recommend it .
Simple to use but needs careful monitoring
I find TripAdvisor to give a reasonable guide to utilise when looking for information on places we're visiting .
I find you need to read through a number of reviews to get an overall impression as there are often extremes of opinion that seem too good or bad to be true .
However when taking into account a number of reviews we've generally found that the impression gained from others has given a good representation and we've found a number of very nice places to eat and stay , which we may not have found without this site
Simple and cost effective
Makes it very easy to quickly see alternative tyre options and particularly like the " all inclusive " price unlike a number of competitors where the headline price is good but then the buy price adds on all the " hidden extras ".
Good price , prompt delivery .
After searching a few sites I found the product I wanted at a good price .
It was easy to search and find the required product and easy to purchase .
Whilst not the absolute cheapest site for this product the extra cashback available via TopCashback made this the best buy .
There was good communication regarding the delivery process and it was a pleasant surprise to also receive a voucher for a future purchase .
Will be using this company again .
Browsing is very well organized which is great because there is a huge selection .
There are always sales going on so I recommend signing up for the email list if you are a frequent shopper .
Checkout is quick and convenient .
Got the part I needed very happy
Great smooth transaction got the part I needed no complaints .

prompt clear process
straight forward competitive on line retail site
Awesome , quick , easy , money money money !
Was great , All I did was go online , pick my phone models , and then choose whether it was working or not working .
There were clear guidelines for what was considered working or not working and I actually considered my phone borderline not working because of some cosmetic damage but they honored it and my payment arrived 2 days later !
Good service i ordered on a Monday evening and my order was delivered Tuesday afternoon .
Haven't got anything free samples yet and have ordered supplements a few times .
Saved me $$$

Jealous of Joules ...
My husband bought me a pair of Joules wellies , dog print ..
I absolutely love them .
Very comfortable and a great fit .
Super prompt delivery from GardenXL and a at great price .
A no nonsense experience - exactly what I wanted - a very good service
Would highly recommend using AnyVan .
Easy to use and excellent results .
Pure Formulas is THE BEST !
I have ordered many items from Pure Formulas , and I am always very satisfied , but I'll have to say that my very favorite is the Living Foods brand Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil .
It adds a unique , tropical flavor to all of the veggies that I saute , and when I bake with it , people always comment that the cake has a very nice , moist texture , and it has a certain something that is very yummy , but they can't quite pinpoint what it is .
It is , by far , the best tasting and healthiest oil to cook and bake with .
I order only from Pure Formulas because they have the best products , the best price and the fastest shipping around .
Great job .
Order was done very well ; done quickly , and without a hitch .
These people have knowledge of the product and are willing to spend the time needed to answer almost all reasonable questions .
Top of the range service
Fantastic service good communication , accurate product description would use this company again 10/10 .
Classic clothing for the autumn weather .
Great style and quality perfect fit speedy service great .
Delivered in two days at no extra cost
The fuel was delivered in two days after quoting 10-12 and the delivery was included in the quote .
I love onnit
Alpha brain , T+ , and shroom tech get me goin for some zombie bell swings !
Get fed with hemp force and buffalo bars , then clean it up for the ladies with defense soap .
Livin the good life !
Horrible experience never booking with book it again .
I received an error message when I submitted my vacation online when I called the lady was very rude and told me that my vacation package had gone up and there was no way to cancel since the hotel part had gone through .
When asking why and what we could do about this and other questions she didn't have any answers and would put me on holds for periods of 15 minutes or more .
It was very scary feeling insecure about just spending 9000 on my family vacation and not knowing what was going on she even wanted me to book the flight myself and that was the whole idea of looking for a package .
This was the simplest and easiest passport experience ever .
I was assigned a specific person ( Cindy Bulu ) who I could reach by both phone and email .
She kept me updated , and my passport was sent over one week earlier from when I was told to expect it .
Perfect service , will use again when needed .
Fantabulous service !
Great service !
Fast and friendly !!
Very helpful !!!
Extremely helpful and kind !
The man who helped me was very nice and was sure to give me many options as to which tires would be best for my car .
In addition , I found an online price that was $140 cheaper than TFT 's and he was able to match it .
This was my first time using Shipsticks ... easy to use and delivered my clubs ahead of time !
This service was outstanding .
Picked up my clubs from my home and delivered them ahead of time for a very reasonable price .
Definitely recommend Shipsticks !
1st time customer and will be a returning customer as needed .
Ordered a part from PartsGeek and was very happy .
Easy to order , great price , and easy to return the core .
Wouldn't hesitate to use them again .

Very friendly and easy to deal with .
American Flag Storage
Thanks to Eric , renting a storage space was super easy !
The move-in special came with insurance , a lock ( which is yours to keep) , a free moving truck , dollies , hand trucks , and a really nice and clean storage unit .
Thanks so much !
FUNTIME AT SPAREFOOT
The most fun had at anytime while shopping and spending my money .
Anthony made the time spent enjoyable and helpful
reliable and good support
Batronix has good products at good price , having the client as priority .
Thanks for your service .
Good product , excellant service
The toothbrush heads I ordered seem to be acceptable replacement for the branded equivalent and were a very good price .
The ordering process was easy and the goods arrived promptly .
Went like clockwork
Initially I was a little concerned as after I had booked the pickup I came across some of the not so good reviews however my concerns were completely unfounded .
Our airport pickup was waiting at the airport when we arrived in Krakow .
After a short wait for two more people we were transported to our hotel .
The driver gave me a card with the details of the return pickup on it which I unfortunately managed to mislay .
However I easily got them from the website .
On the morning we left the driver arrived exactly at the time stated and we were dropped off at the airport in ample time for the flight .
I was very pleased with the service provided and would use Resorthoppa again .
Nice linen basket
The colour of the basket is different to the picture , which was what attracted me to it in the first place .
However it is a more natural colour and I now think it is nicer .
The linen basket is a reasonable size and looks neat and tidy .
I am very pleased with the purchase which arrived very speedily and well packaged .
A Good Experience
The item ordered arrived very quickly and was well packaged .
I have no cause to complain about the service I received .
Shower Doctors delivers the service others should aspire to !
Absolutely faultless !!
Keen price , superb delivery , excellent communication and quality product .
The benchmark for others .
Worthy of recommendation to anyone without reservation .
Affordable Buttons printed and produced our buttons with a fluidity and finesse unmatched in our prior experience .
These guys did a great job .
Their quick , easy ordering process is reminiscent of a bird in flight : it invokes calm and a lightness of heart that floats you through the cool days of early spring like fallen petals from a young cherry tree .
Friendly service is offered freely , as you might expect from inhabitants of an ancient mountain village never yet exposed to the cruelties and abandon of modern society .
This sumptuous promotional-product pastry is lovingly frosted with the deft production of an utterly satisfactory final product , shimmering with the gloss of achievement and the sheen of new , enduring hope ; and delivered with cataract-inducing speed .
Was helped with snow-tire change-over in a friendly and efficient manner .
Great Price and Quality , Helpful Staff
Purchased an engagement ring in the Summer of last year .
Anthony offered great help and assistance in choosing the right stone as well as the right setting for our budget .
We ended up with a really high quality diamond ( triple excellent ) for a very reasonable price .
This is why I'm coming back to Brilliance again this time of year to also get our wedding rings , because this company and its staff know how to deliver the product and treat their customers .
Flower Power .
Ordered my first bunch of flowers for my elderly sister in law 's birthday .
Usually use Interflora and thought I'd try Iflorist instead .
Was not disappointed .
Flowers arrived and looked exactly as they appeared on the website .
Much cheaper too !
Will definitely use again .
Great price on our flights
I would recommend checking Travelocity as they had better prices then the airline did .
Won't purchase anymore Superdry products
Wrong size was sent and to return item would've been $100 to send back item since Superdry does not pay for return postage .
Just wasted $90
Great Front LIne Customer Service .
I've been an Ink Farm customer for a little while now .
Buying ink cartridges for my old beat-up Epson .
I noticed one particular batch of ink ran out much sooner than was usual and not being a complete idiot , I realized the machines software is refusing to print even though the cartiridges were removed , checked out and vigorously shaken to prove they were probably still about half full .
I realize there is always going to be a percentage of ink left in any used and empty cartridge , and indeed there needs to be for a variety of reasons , ( even though the industry tells us the ink is only worth pennies .
) Not satisfied , I e-mailed a complaint to Ink Farm and they replaced those cartiridges the same day without question , free of charge .
In all honesty , a good argument could have been made about the quality of my printer or its software being the responsible negative factor .
Regardless , Ink Farm didn't want to hear anything about it .
To them , the customer , even a small banana 's customer like myself , was unhappy ; there was no way they were going to risk losing a customer or the goodwill generated and did what they had to do to ensure customer satisfaction .
That 's a dedicated company for you .
That 's a company you should be doing business with .
Ordered last minute and they arrived within 36hours .
Was a little apprehensive but needn't have worried , as they are a great purchase and I would have no hesitation in recommending .
Great , central location
Ideal accomodation , centrally located with everything you need for a short stay .
Apartment was spotless - would highly recomend
Excellent part at very resonable price
Looking for replacement parts and thoyght about you last .
The best thing is I know how much I saved by doing that .
You will be my first choice next time not just because of the price for parts but also the fastest shipping I have experienced .
Great service , fast delivery , quality arts
Excellent - fast and understandable
I booked through this site on internal work recomendation - i found it fast , easy to use and i will definatly use HRS again - and recommend to my work colluges .
GREAT PARTS , GREAT PRICE
Part was as described , Online guides were perfect .. no issues .
Would recommend .
great service !!
Just order it from HQhair . com you wont be disappointed
Quick , easy and had a great person helping me !
My time in the phone was great , the person I talked to was very knowledgable and easy to work with .
I will use this again ..
I spent endless nights after work searching for hotel after hotel and eventually stumbled upon easytobook.com i was so relieved to quite openly see price breakdowns and clear descriptions of facilities and location of the hotel , The reservation was very easy and everytime i checked the price on the website - unlike others- the prices never seemed to fluctuate so i took the opportunity to lock in the reasonable pric e.I was sent an e-mail conformation to take with me upon my arrival at the hotel and had a very pleasant stay .
Would 100% recommend !
Express delivery .
Easy to use website , speedy and lenses delivered very quickly .
Flat packed so goes through your letter box .
Have used several times .
solid dog barrier -- crappy S&H experience
The product itself is really high quality .
I just installed it in my 2012 Touareg TDI .
Installation was very simple and straightforward .
Longest part I spent was cutting my Weathertech cargo liner at the rear D-ring holes to allow me to complete installation of the Travall dog barrier ( I wanted to be precise) .
The problem was shipping -- Travall didn't provide a commercial invoice so I spent about an hour or so of my time between FedEx and the company trying to get FedEx what it needed to be able to clear customs .
Then , when the product arrived , it was poorly packaged and literally one chunk of the product was sticking straight out of the box .
For $170 and another $45 in shipping , you can imagine this was unacceptable .
Luckily the product wasn't materially damaged -- just a small scuff on the corner that was sticking out .
Annoying to be sure , but not worth the hassle of shipping it back for another one in my opinion , especially after the customs hassle I dealt with .
One final note -- overall , even with the customs SNAFU , shipping was super speedy .
To my surprise , I got it within a couple of days of ordering it ( I live in New England) .
Looks fantastic in my Touareg .
Definitely recommend the product .
Exceed in all categories !
Excellent service , I have only found a cheaper price elsewhere once , and I used there low price guarantee and they beat it !
Don't shop anywhere else tons of free stuff too !
Simply the best !
Cash4Books . net rocks !
I would like to know how Cash4Books . net determines their pricing for I would like to maximize their payments .
A very satisfied customer
Prompt delivery .
Well packaged .
Definitely will use them again !
No comparison to the competion !
Online ordering was very quick and easy .
Received order in a timely manner .
Very satisfied .
Great First Time Buying Experience
First time I used Inkfarm .
Called customer Service ( on a Sunday ) to have delivery address changed .
Did so very easily .
Will be back when I need ink in the future .
This was a very good transaction .
I always appreciate a dealer that takes the time and effort to describe an item with accuracy .
My doll came almost instantly it seemed .
I would buy from her again without hesitation .
they do not know anything about costumer sevice
Very disappointed about customer service ...
The perfect way to find the exact accommodation to suit your requirements .
The site is very easy to do searches that meet your requirements .
You know here your staying and what services and utilities are included .
Be sure to read the reviews to ensure the property lives up to the description and to ensure a smooth stay .
First time I've used this service and I was very impressed .
Everything worked exactly as it should and we could walk to the terminal and then back again on our return - and the price was cheaper than in the mid term car park when you have to fuss around with buses .
I'll certainly use this service again .
Unbelievably fast and quick .
My request for unlocking iPhone 5s AT&T got rejected by bone of the top rated website , I thought of trying out here at keys2iphone and give it a shot .
They replied within 2 days of submitting my request stating that it 's unlocked simply unbelievably fast .
Happy with my order
ReglazeMyGlasses did everything they said they would – on time and for a good price .
I would definitely use them again and recommend them in a heartbeat .
I've used Supplement Warehouse several times in the past and have always been pleased with their products and service .
Doesn't hurt that they offer so much free stuff either !
Throughly Enjoyable Experience
Well detailed talk all along the bus journey
What a great pleasure to do business with a truly professional company .
When i ordered i did so with the wrong measurement , instead of just sending what i asked for they queried what i had asked for and sent me the correct item and correct measurements .
A high quality product and a highly professional team .
I recommend this company to anyone and everyone .
Found the envelopes I wanted , although I had hoped to have more of a colour and stock range ( I got the minature envelopes) .
They arrived in no time though which was great
Best service online
Purchased Wii fit plus with the balance board for just under £30 with their usual free next day delivary .
Arrived the next day , with the product as described .

perfect lenses fast delivery
This service was one i wasn't to sure about when i first logged on as i normally buy my contact lenses through a opticians .
But due to my current disappointment from one opticians about the price of a months supply i then tried Tesco 's opticians and was dissatisfied about how they never seemed to have my prescription in store .
This service was exactly what i was looking for good quality good price fast delivery perfect .
Great deals , fast postage .
Would really recommend it to anyone
Very good , but only buy if am on a tight budget .
Great company , good protein , very helpful .
But i only buy from here if i want to try get something cheaply .
Normally look at affordable supplements first before i look on my protein .
Saying that though the my protein bundles are amazingly good value and a lot cheaper than anywhere else .
Best price found
Great company , cheapest price i found , parts are great quality , fast shipping would use again and have recommend to others .
Inexpensive , fast shipping & awesome

Hostelworld doesn't lie !
Good Parts , and good time on the shipping love it !!!
;) ) Thanks
I could not have had a better experience and the product is beautiful !
From the very beginning Bethany was so helpful .
She absolutely made my experience ordering from outside the country an easy one .
The USBs and box are both so beautiful !
I cannot wait to share these with my clients !
I will absolutely order from here again and shout to the rooftop that I love this company !!
Excellent Service !
Very Happy Repeat Customer !
Excellent Service !
Brillant Communication !
Superfast Delivery !
It was very easy to order and the delivery was super fast
Ordered a sale item - good price - told me what day it would come ( after Christmas break ) and it came on the promised day .
All good .
Excellent service what more could you ask for
Prices are way better than GNC even with shipping included .
Fourth time ordering .
Love it .
Quick and good prices
Quick and good prices
Product as expected .
Super fast shipping
Best online service I've ever had .
Ordered 4 items this months and there amazing
I wouldn't use any other online music store .
Every order I've made I've had it within 48 hours .
Also I've always price checked before I brought a item and they have also been the cheapest .
100% going to shop with gak again
great deal ...
Very helpful in finding my storage unit ... fast , efficient .
Armstrong Steel delivered a great product with the best pricing , materials , and lines of communication I have experienced in a while .
Would highly recommend this company to anyone looking to build a steel building .
Great fast cheap service
Item was delivered quickly and in perfect condition , with free gift too .
Would definitely recommend .
Great company - will use again
Great products at a great price .
Fast delivery and very well packaged considering it was two ice axes that I had ordered !
No hesitation in recommending .
Great product and spectacular turnaround !
Everyone loved the buttons .
The Best Harringtons on Earth !
Just picked up my fourth HARRINGTON from Baracuta .
Instantly recognisable jackets .
Great service .
Will be back for more .
Really fast delivery !
I ordered a Boker Nano folding knife online on Tuesday morning .
It arrived the next day .
Can't ask for more than that .
Waited for new log in password , never received email .
Log in for existing costomer , forgotten password did not work to reset password .
Had to re register as new customer .
No email sent .
The Feliway and Frontline were both good prices .
Shipped same day .
Nice service !
Awesome stock music and other media , found quickly
For a Kickstarter video for recording an audiobook for one of my novels , I was looking for pirate-themed music .
I was willing to pay for licensed music , but was having trouble finding good samples just from titles alone .
Pond5 's mouse-over autoplay feature really made it easy to quickly sample a clip and discover the ones that matched the feeling I desired .
I found several that I purchased , and put several more on a list to purchase later .
I've already recommended the site to several of my friends .
Wonderful experience !
fantastic online shopping experience
It came fast well packaged .
the service was 2nd to non and the fact that you can use PayPal made it a great all round shopping experience
Good selection , good web site .
My order came quickly .
The only glitch was that it came in two parts without notice .
They were four identical parts - bearings .
Three came on one day , and one came three days later .
There was no explanation with the first shipment that the second one was coming , so I lodged an unnecessary complaint with PartsGeek thinking that the order was screwed up .
quick and efficient
next day delivery perfect when your in a hurry !
simple transactions no fuss !
very efficient and professional service
Was recomeended to Questor by a family member .
I found the online form very easy to navigate and was fully insured within a few minutes .
Professional and Efficient
Ordering the table was very straightforward .
We were able to view the item at various angles and get a good feel for its size and construction .
There was nothing left to chance .
Completly satisfied .
Country Attire was a good way of shopping .
My package arrived the day after my order .
you get what you pay for and I can't complain .
Order was handled quickly and efficiently .
I have had no issues when ordering plastic cards .
My experience has been pleasant and I get good service .
A great product , price and speed of delivery !
Cannot fault these Braun replacement brushes in any way , nor the price and speed of delivery from Molarclean .
I wish I had found out about this company years ago as I could have saved a fortune .
Good customer service ...
Product was dry and blotchy but replacements were sent promptly
Bought ink from ink farm but the ink they sent me was dry and printing was blotchy , hopefully the next time will be better as I will give it a second shot
Cheaper , faster , better .
Ordered online and the parts were at my door in 2 days ...... wow
Great customer service
I places an order for my son and needed to cancel it .
They wrote back promptly and followed up .
I couldn't be happier with that kind of service !
Great service and features !
The front desk staff were friendly and helpful .
They provided a full breakfast , and it changed daily .
It was nice to have service and not a same stuff different day approach .
Cleanliness : The hotel was clean and cozy .
wrong shoe size & received two left foots as a pair of boots .
Well first off , I ordered thigh high boots size 7 .
I received one of the boot size 7 for the right foot , and the other boot was size 8 for the right foot also .
I'm so disappointed and bothered by the fact I have to return those boots because of this shops mistake .
How Easy is This
First of all , I don't need Trustpilot prompting me on how to address an opinion regarding services and or products .
This is only our third order with PetFlow however it could not have gone any easier or smoother .
Both phone calls placed have been professionally handled in a matter of minutes .
The internet is an attractive option and is easy to navigate allowing you to order or make changes with a quick click .
If you place your order early in the week and live close to a distribution center you may receive your order within 24 hours as we have .
Great Service and Awesome Surprise Deals
Keep the Surprise Deals/Closeouts Coming !
Very unbeatable prices and service .
Thank you !
Honolulu car rental
We've used Priceline probably 6 times for hotel stays .... we decided to use it for a car rental on our Hawaii vacation .... it was easy and saved us over 1/2 from the other deals I could find on the internet .
We would use it again for a car rental for sure .
It'll cost you , but Rush Passport is worth every penny
I found myself in a position where I had to scramble to replace a lost passport before an international trip .
This would normally be a very stressful situation , but Rush Passport delivered as promised and did so even faster than they said they would .
I provided my documentation and they took care of the rest .
They were also very friendly and answered any and all questions I had .
I would absolutely recommend their services .
Epic work in short time
I am so pleased with their transcription .
I submitted 3 interviews of 70+ minutes , and had received complete , near flawless transcriptions in less than 36 hours .
It would have taken me weeks of using all of my limited free time to do work that only approached the end product I received .
I plan on using REV for all my future interviews that require transcription in the future of my research career .
Fast , great service !
Excellent service , speedy delivery and good prices !
Fast delivery , great customer service , competitive prices and will be ordering from them again .
I have used the website twice now to order my contacts .
The prices are so much better than any other website I visited and any high street retailer .
They provide contacts from all the big brands .
Also , provide an aftercare service .
I've never used this so far , but it 's good to know the service is there just in case .
Overall , I would recommend this website .
So far so good ........
Took a long time to choose the right one .... hope it 's what I expect .
Reviews look good .
its not the same
I ordered the Siberian Monmouth tusk vodka at Christmas and it came chilled with a wooden box what had straw in it .
Iv just bought the same for my partner 's birthday and it came in a small cardboard box room temp no wooden box and it has bits in the vodka ?
Wasn't impressed at all
Large selection , speedy service
Worst possible service ever for online eyeglass purchase !!
The original order for glasses was back ordered/out of stock for over a month .
When I changed it in order to speed up the process for needed glasses that took 2 plus weeks and the glasses were too big .
Reordered again and had to keep emailing to see where the new ones were .
Lost 15% due to restocking lenses .
Just an awful experience .
Shop online somewhere else .
Fast shipping and just as described .
Will use them again .
Top notch service !
In an overdue effort to give up smoking , I decided to try the route of vaping and , through a friends recommendation , bought the starter kit from eCigWizard .
Delivery was the next day after it was processed and the goods arrived in perfect condition .
For me , this is the way to go to quit and ordered the iMist ( wonderfully smooth ) and more liquid .
Again , delivered next day and in perfect condition .
Great service and quality products .
Recommended without hesitation .
My first time experience was excellent
Great selection of quality brands , reasonable prices and super fast shipping .
My new go to site !
it is a great site
I will shop again
when i buy something from lightinthebox i always get them in time and always satisfied .
i really recommend this site thank you lightinthebox .
mario borg malta
very pleased with website and products , fast shipping too
see above comments
that 's great
the items are very well and your service is also very well .
especially , the priority mail , I got the items only two days
Great service , especially great support .
Recently purchased a Bioshock Infinite key as my first ever purchase from CJS-CDKEYS .
They run a system called " AutoKey " which is designed to prevent fraud .
I had a little problem with the verification process , so I contacted support .
When I contacted , I got a reply back within 5 minutes .
This has to be one of the fastest support teams I have seen .
From there , I was able to sort out my problem without much trouble .
After this , I received my Steam Key , and it worked .
Would definitely recommend .
Thanks CJS-CDKEYS .
Great service and product !
My McNeill of Barra kilt and kilt Linacre fantastic and I will wear them both with pride .
fast delivery , and product received as described !
I love free shipping at any company , and I was very pleased with the " squigz " the whole family enjoys them .
thanks again !
Brilliant customer service , excellent price and products .
From visiting the showroom to ordering the tiles online the experience was faultless .
The products are excellent , a very large selection and hugely discounted .
Great customer service and prompt delivery .
Awesome Service/Products - wish I started using them sooner
Fantastic products , managed to get discount too before vat rise , so overall super happy .
Will definately use them again .
The banana flavour is awesome , have always preferred to stick with chocolate flavours and needed a change .
Good store and fast delivery
fast and efficient
They were very helpful , reliable & we would recomend to all .
They did everything you would ask for from an appliance company from stocking the item you are looking for at a reasonable price , keeping you informed the whole way through from taking the order to an hour before the delivery and delivering free so no extra costs to be hit with after placing the order .
This is our third time of using this company and they have been consistent with every order , excellent !
Don't ever use this service
My wife made the mistake of believing that the Reservation counter website was actually the Holiday Inn website that she usually uses .
To book my reservation for three nights direct with Holiday Inn would have cost us with all taxes , blah , blah , blah exactly $ 409.20 .
Booking the exact same room with Reservation counter cost us $ 480.19 , a difference of $ 70.99 .
for the pleasure of using a spurious website cleverly disguised as the " real Holiday Inn " website .
The counter person at the Holiday Inn said this has happened before to other Holiday Inn customers .
Shipping was slower this time but everything else was exceptional .
Recommend to anyone over the other optical sites .
Easy to do , fun to give !
So glad we found this site .
Wanted to send a check card as a birthday present .
Couldn't believe it when we saw we could add our own picture too !
Looked great .
Our Aunt loved it .
Will definitely use again .
Very easy to deal with
The web site has all the information you need .
Good prices and delivery very quick
Nice easy web site , good parts list and quick delivery
Easy to use web site .
Just enter your car registration number and it finds your car .
Good parts diagram .
After searching the web , this was the best site for pumps at the right price .
Good informative web site .
Easy to use and good links to manufactuers information .
Prices good and delivery spot on
Kepted informed all the way through to transaction , from order to delivery .
I will be using them again
AMAZINGLY FAST AND SECURE
Purchased 60 days WoW gametime , received my code instantly after verifying my details and entering my SMS security code .
Would use again :)
5 star service at budget prices .
Nothing much to say other than keep doing what you do .
Very helpful booking website
I always use HRS when I book hotel in Europe .
It really provide me great help .
Will come again .
The only way I remember to order !
Not only are the they cheapest source of my particular contacts , not only do they save my prescription details saving me time and hassle , but they even send a reminder when I'm nearly out so that I never ever runout just before a holiday or important meeting .
It 's a brilliant service !
Brillian , fast efficient service
First time using this company as I couldn't find 3-lens packs anywhere else .
It was really easy to order , user friendly website , and really quick service .
Lenses arrived two days later .
mSpy For Kids
There is no doubt that mSpy is a good monitoring software .
Parents can use this application to watch what their children are doing and where they are .
The best part about this program , for me personally , is that I can monitor calls , emails and IM application usage .
This means that I do not have to worry so much about my kids since I can intercept their activities on their phone without being noticed , any time I like .
Took about a week to get my money ( I'm on the east coast) .
Overall an easy experience .
Will do business again
Nothing else to say really .
They do what they say they will do , it 's that simple .
Good job well done .
Happy Customer !
the service worked just as it should
Good location great price and Excellent Service by management
Horrible , Horrible , Horrible ...
I ordered several items which shipped in four parts .
The first , an expansion tank , was the only thing that arrived , inside the box was some sort of " U " shaped bracket .
How anybody could possibly mistake that for an expansion tank is amazing .
On the second part I didn't put the apartment number on the order , I tried to contact PartsGeek and I could not get a person on the phone to make a change .
Then UPS , after failing to deliver it , said they had instructions from the shipper to return it to them so although I called and spoke with UPS to try to get it delivered to me they sent it back to PartsGeek .
I called PartsGeek and was on hold two separate times for 30 minutes only to get an automated message telling me they were busy and then it hung up on me .
Then I called at 2:10 Pacific time and got a message that they were closed .
Also , the order was returned by the shipper to PartsGeek , five days ago and they still have not contacted me in any way to arrange to have it re-shipped or to return my money .
I have never had such horrible service from any parts dealer , and I have ordered from quite a few .
No hassle ordering , shipped on time got what I expected .
I ordered , and received what I wanted .
No problems and quick delivery .
Can't ask for more than that .
I Ordered a heater hose for a 1996 acura integra gsr .
The hose i recieved was not for a gsr it was about 5 inches to short .
It 's all good
Great selection and pricing .
No problems or other issues , went off without a hitch .
watch the shipping
I ordered a power steering pump for a 2003 caddy
they had the best price on a rebuild and fast shipping
the unit worked great
the core charge was $ 15.00
the problem is the return shipping is $ 14.00 plus insurance
its not worth it to return the core
so ill just scrap the core
I would still recommend them
great price great product and fast delivery
the best the most complete pro source
I don't buy anything for my studio anywhere else .
B&H helped me purchase all the gear for my commercial studio .
Their expertise is unmatched .
A great service to avoid worrying about traveling with your golf equipment .
Fast response .
Faultless Service .
My experience with Anyvan was great from start to finish .
Very user friendly website .
Up to date information available with one click .
Phone service also good as a backup when you need to confirm things .
Wide range of drivers and delivery companies to choose from .
The ones I chose were fabulous .
Very competitive price and excellent service .
Knockdown prioce .
Speedy dispatch .
Very good service .
Dolphin does it - again !
First time customer , so don't know why I'm saying ' again ' except I will use them again and again .
Brilliant prices , excellent comms , first rate delivery .
Does what it says it will .
Great company great service I will use again Many Thanks
Great 1st class service , ordered and delivered on time , great communication throughout , will recommend friends
Rich Tone Music ( ROCKS !!!!
Many thanks for a super fast service at the best price I could find .
Super Guitar Strings , excellent communication , a company that would be hard to beat , for price , and service , many thanks Mike
Great service from a great company .
A very good service , easy to use , fast and reliable delivery .
Got my brake pads 2 days after ordering them .
Keep up the good work Many thanks
You made my purchase very easy and accomadated my special needs by offering many options for me to choose from .
One option you missed was a battery charger plug that could be used in the USA .
By the way , this groupset(Di2 ) was installed on a Merlin Agilis and even though external , looks great .
I do a LOT of online shopping and I have never had the experience I had with Oogalights !
I put in my order Friday , 12/6 , at around 9 a.m. and by Saturday , 12/7 , around 9:10 a . m .
I had the package !
And the product is just what I was looking for .
This is a 5 star company , no question !
Great , just a little pricey for me
Great location , no problems with any staff , just dont entirely like the rolling doors being locked at night due to me trying to put away my bike and I had to go through the regular door .
love their clothes
Such trendy and wonderful clothes !
Love them so much !
airline tickets were great , motel was okay for a Quality Inn , The car rental was not good at all ..
Picked up the car and before the first day was out it started to overhead .
will more then likely not rent from Budget again
I was very suprised at how quick the delivery was and how very well packaged my items were , the products i bought were the cheapest going with free delivery and with all the free samples i had recieved it was a win win situation .
PANTS WAS NOT PANTS
Delivery and packaging was excellent , always great value for money and great service .
Will purchase again .
No Hassle easy process .
No hassle easy way to buy a diamond if you do your homework first .
I recommend a US certified diamond .
Only problem was a prong holding the diamond was slightly bent , easy fix but had me worried .
Everything else was a smooth as could be .
Great bargain for folks on a budget .
( and even those that aren't!
After looking at hotels and hostels for the 4 of us , I was discouraged about the prices .
Then I saw Housetrip .
We found an apt .
within our budget that allowed us to easily get around Paris , stay together as a family ( unlike a hostel) , and cook some of our own meals - all at a price better than anything I saw elsewhere !!
We were pleased with the entire process , though it is a bit time consuming to choose , send a notice , wait for a reply , etc .
Easier to just choose and book .
But worth it in the long run because we were very pleased .
Easy to communicate with our host , which we did quite often before our trup .
Love the product , referred by my doctor !
Just starting using this product which was referred by my doctor and I'm seeing great results .
it is beautiful but i expected my dress to be exactly as appear in the picture .
Glad we found Parts Geek for our diesel vw beetle .
This site is just amazing !
Not only do they have everything I could ever need for my 2006 Diesel Volkswagen Beetle .
It is resonably priced which is great !
But the timely manner in which you recieve your order is just great !
I would reccommend Parts Geeks to anyone looking for quality parts with fast shipping and GREAT prices .
So glad that we found you !
Great , but too many follow-up emails .
My one sentence opinion pretty much is my " full review ".
Thank you for the help finding my storage facility :)
Competitive prices and fast shipping
It was such a relief to buy a 35 lb bag of pet food without having to lug it into the car .
I would most definitely purchase with Pet Flow again .
super quick service
placing order was easy as could be
delivery super quick
best site for cd keys
fantastic website , i've bought 2 games from them and their service is prompt and reliable .
Always fast and reliable
Would highly recommend to anyone .
Good shiping time and partes are good thx
The only place to men 's shaving and grooming products online
This company is spectacular and was quick with fulfilling my order and having it shipped extremely quick to my house .
Great overview and alot of choice !
Great site its easy to navigate and so much choice !
hope i get my order soon so ill know if i can give it 5 stars : 3
just started taking them will wait till the next CT scan , to see if there is any change
Best Service and Rates !
Ordered and received within 3 days ( I chose the delivery date) , best euro rate I could find anywhere .
Have used quite a few times now and will do so again without any hesitation .
Would recommend to anyone .
Ordered Friday received Monday .
Excellent service . Cheapest price I could find as well , can't go wrong .
When you have multiple dogs price and speedy delivery are a big factor .
Plus , free delivery !!
what more can you ask for ?
I trust B & H for the best advice , best products , consistently good value .
The on-line chat was very helpful and saved a trip to the store .
The advice was more direct than on-line reviews , although they came to the same conclusions .
I know B & H will stand by its products .
they have good prices easy access and very good delivery time overall a good place to deal with I would recommend them to friends
I will not be ordering from you again ,
The reason is it say 's you will deliver the ink in two days , it took 6 your ink is already running out i only had it one week
poor service and poor quality this is not the first time this is my 2nd
Very good service
Scott and his team did a great job and found where to process passport at very short nice .
Great overall view
I rarely use these kind of websites ...
The overall look is great , it also looks professional so the website seems well constructed .
The fact that there is an app is also cool and useful !
It makes it easier to take and bet on your favorite sports , anywhere and whenever you like .
Also , the statistics were clear , well structured and informative .
You guys should consider more publicity ...
I have done many jobs on promoting websites on networks , blogs , social media and even youtube !
Just people seeing your name might recognize your company and say '' yeah I remember that site''... Keep in mind that nothing works more than a good comment from a friend .
pets jump for joy when petflow does their thing
petflow has not let us down , they have the food items and toys my four cats love .
for me having it come to the house is wonderful and so many items to choose from .
no negativity here as my four felines are happy so I am happy . and they are healthier as well ... which makes me very happy :-)
Parts fit the first time .
I got timely arrival of Part , and it fit .
Best service , best price
Don't waste time and energy searching .
DRI Scuba has the best service and the best price .
Excellent Customer Service
I have been in the Customer Service industry since 1995 and I feel that they have mastered the skill .
My Item was going to be on back order , not only did they email me , but they called me as well to ask me what I wanted to do .
Also , a small error occurred and they fixed it right away sending me a postage paid return envelope and the scrub pants I needed .
Quick and easy
I found the hole service was very good , when I was purchasing my item , I found that the transaction was very easy and was done in no time .
My order was dispatched in good time and I received it in two days .
I was very happy with this .
The cardboard packaging was very nice .
overall I was very pleased with the hole service and would highly recommend you to other people .
I will be buying from you again very soon .
Books are as described and VERY FAST !
This is my first time renting books but I was impressed with how easy it was to locate the books I needed and how quickly they arrived .
Totally cheaper than buying a new book , and what a waste that is also using it for a couple months and then ... what ?
Throw it away ?
Keep it on a shelf ?
Nope - renting is the answer !
ordered friday night of a bank holiday and received the order on wednesday .
Everything was as ordered .
Will defo use again .
Excellence all the way
PetFlow . com is the most efficient etailer I've ever dealt with over the years .
Easy to order , great prices , affordable shipping and overall excellence on ever count .
My dogs never miss out on their favorite food because " I forgot to go to the store ".
The scheduled shipments are easily adjusted and always on time .
They save my behind all the time .
I thank them and my dogs thank them .
Plenty of choice , easy ordering , speedy delivery
The web site is easy to use the ordering and payment simple and the delivery is fast
A stockist with stock and a good range of items .
Goods despatched very quickly with clear despatch details .
Exellent shopping ecperience
A very good product , easy online shop , good communication and quick delivery - Thank you
A great experience and I know I will return !
I had a great experience with Social Skateboarding , they have good customer service and amazing prices .
I am the type of person to search for quite a while to find the best price possible and Social is the place with the best prices .
They only carry quality products and their community gives you a chance to hear opinions form others who know what they are talking about .
Highly Recommend you make your purchase from Social !!
Quick , efficient and helpful
My sewing machine feet were sent out promptly .
There was a blip with my first order which meant that I had four order confirmations and I was concerned that four payments had been taken .
I had a very prompt and polite reply to my panic email and everything was put right straight away .
i will certainly use this company again .
PureFormulas is GREAT !
Pure Formulas is my favorite place to order supplements and health products on line because they do not charge shipping and handling and they mail very quickly .
There prices are competitive with other online stores of the same type , so you can not lose by ordering from them .
Love my new stethoscope !
I recently bought the Classic II S . E .
stethoscope and I couldn't be happier with my purchase .
The quality of this item is great and worth the price , especially with the free engraving which looks awesome !
Shipping was quick , but annoying since the package was sent FedEx Home Delivery and I had to be home to sign for the package or reroute pickup .
Overall , I definitely recommend this product and company !
Everything fit perfectly
Fast Service .
My lenses arrived 3 days after the order was placed - fast and excellent service .
Does what it says on the tin
Efficient booking service , parcel collected promptly by UPS the next day and it arrived as stated in Bavaria , soon after we arrived to see the family ; most impressive .
Service from Trading Depot was first class .
My order arrived the next day on the time specified
I would thoroughly recommend Trading Depot as their price and service beats anyone else .
Perfect service and fast delivery
I got just what I wanted from garden XL and ordering online was very easy .
superb service and great prices !!
I needed a refund as colour of jacket chosen didn't suit me and the speed of refund was faster than any other online retailers which I think is an important factor
So far I have made two puchases from this site and I am impressed with the results .
I have purchased tail light assemblies for a 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 and head light assemblies for a Ford Ranger ( 98 ) and received both sets in a timely manner and both met or exceeded my expectations .
There was a signifigant difference in the price from one taillight which had been bought from a store earlier .
I will continue to order parts and accessories from this site in the future .
Great prices and service !
I had a great experience with this company .
They went above and beyond in customer service , the prices are great and so are the products .
I definitely be buying more from this site .
Not happy waited a whole week to recieve the wrong product
You have good deals but your service is not to good sorry
Best price for a quality brand name part
parts geek saved me $40 over the next lowest price for same part ! This is the second time i used them and plan on using again !
good service , fast and effective , unfortunately in my opinion should improve reimbursement times
Improving , but still have a ways to go
I really don't know how to elaborate , sorry .
I think your loyalty points program makes you unique and you should continue that/improve it .
Definitely ordering from Diabloskinz in the future
Service was excellent , no problems ordering online , product arrived in good time , product was great quality and fit my device perfectly .
Joseph Jewelry is simply AMAZING !
My husband and I both love our anniversary rings from Joseph Jewelry !
From customer service , to design and craftsmanship , the process was flawless and the team at Joseph Jewelry did an AMAZING job .
They were able to show us our rings in 3D , the process allowed us to make modifications to what I originally had in mind .
The rings design were perfect , exactly what we wanted .
Production took about 3 weeks and the beautiful work on our rings exceeded all my expectations !
We worked with Joseph and his team virtually through their website and the communication was seamless .
We both are happy clients of Joseph Jewelry and recommend them to all our friends .
good service , customer service needs work
I use delivery.com all the time .
I love the discounts and ease of use , however the customer service could be quicker to respond and take issues more seriously .
I got food poisoning and they gave me some useless points a week later .
Um , thanks .
Convenient , Easy , and Great Promos !
Delivery . com is exactly what it sounds like-a website for delivery purposes .
I've been using the site for several years ( exclusively for food purchases ) and love it !
You simply type in your address , and restaurants in your area that deliver pop up .
You can narrow the search by food type , specials , or even target search a certain dish .
And the best part is the constant promos delivery.com does .
Almost every weekend they send coupons ( like $8 off a $20 order) , plus you get points for each order , allowing you to use the points to cash in for additional discounts , or even other items .
I've never had a problem with an order from them , and use them regularly .
I strongly recommend them !
Good Value .
Great Idea !
I was going on a field trip and returning straight home rather than to uni so sent the clothes I didn't want to lug around with me home via uni baggage .
I was a bit nervous but I shouldn't have worried at all !
Very easy to arrange and everything arrived safe and sound .
Excellent value and would definitely use in future .
Just the ticket !
Brilliant yet again !
Barrington really do have it sussed- a great range at good prices and and excellent service !
it was very convenient and is a site that is very easy to navigate .
i wanted to cancel an order i made my accident and have no problems doing so .
Excellent friendly service !
Even though I was deployed on the other side of the world , service was helpful and friendly .
Fast and Healthy
Thank you for contacting my doctor quickly for my cat 's prescription food , and filling my order quickly and accurately at a better price than my vets .
You can't beat the free shipping !
I am very comfortable ordering from B and H . The price is usually the lowest or equal to other on line sellers .
Shipping is quick as their warehouse is near .
I can speak to a rep quickly who knows the product and is very helpful .
I trust B and H , ordering on line or through their sales group .
Great service and excellent product
Phoned as unsure which stamp I needed and very helpful sales person guided me in the right direction .
Placed order and the following morning the stamp arrived exactly as requested .
Highly recommend this organisation for speed and efficiency of service .
Good quality bathrooms , stylish and great value
Sadly let down by your lack of guaranteed delivery ( unlucky for me but it was not put onto the delivery schedule ) and was told that I would be refunded for the error - sorry but this really isn't adequate as it caused problems with the purchase of the plumbing and runs of pipes etc .
It would appear that there is no mechanism in place to handle mishaps which completely undoes the great kit .
The stylish toilet with its ' hidden soil pipe is a plumbers ' nightmare as it is hard to check if it is leaking until tested .
It needs a lot longer to fit as the plumber is blind to the equipment he is installing .
This design needs modifying as I shan't be buying this again purely on a cost basis as the fitting time is tripled .
Excellent customer service !
This was an easy and smooth transaction and is the second time I have ordered from PureFormulas .
Prices are good with very quick shipping .
I will be back !
Next level Total Human Optimization
Great products and great marketing .
The explanations are straight forward and seem to be less about pushing products and more assisting in finding balance and success .
GREAT , QUALITY PRODUCTS & GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE !!
I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE !
In my opinion the shop was very nice and clean .
The manager helped us very much and was very kind and peaceful .
Paul found us the perfect futon and worked with us ALOT .
I now have no regrets about going out and finding the futon shop !!!!!
I am now very happy with my futon !!!!!
fast delivery and fit was perfect .. 3 mins to install
Absolutely outstanding response and delivery !!
I found the product I was seeking at PetFlow . com , ordered it on a Wednesday , and had it by the next afternoon !!!
The site was very easy to navigate , ordering was simple , service and delivery could not have been better , and I will now order all my pet food from this company .
Furthermore , their prices are competitive , or even lower !
Excellent service that saved time and stress of parking .
We were met on time and car was taken away quickly , and on return a quick call and our car was there waiting in 5 mins .
Will definitely be using you again .
Excellent value for money too .
Communication and stock co-ordination could be better !
Two onesies were ordered , both in stock .
Few days later refund to my account was received .
No e-mail with explanation , no way of finding out which of the two colours had been cancelled .
Not pleased .
a well organized website with good pricing and reasonable shipping .
i will shop here again .
Excellent for small sums , a trickier process for large sums
TransferWise gives an instant currency conversion rate , and works by a transfer of the sum required from the sender 's credit / debit card or Paypal , to Tranferwise 's Barclays a/c .
This is then passed on to the recipient 's foreign bank a/c .
For small sums , this is a relatively quick and painless process , requiring the recipient 's name and their IBAN a/c No .. For larger sums , by the time one has scanned and submitted copies of passport or driving licence for the necessary anti money laundering checks , currency rates can change between starting the transfer and completion .
The process might be quicker if the necessary documentation has been previously submitted .
However it is certainly cheaper the normal international bank transfers .
Great Prices .
Reliable Company .
Good Turnover Time .
Have yet to be disappointed !
I couldn't have asked for better service
I called Country Attire twice on two separate queries about the Liberty Freedom range .
Really helpful , professional and friendly attitude which is a great help if you're buying online and have a few questions .
Received the goods the next day , the parcel was tracked and gave me a delivery time .
The Liberty Freedom range is expensive , but beautiful , and made in England !, I've been to Berlin this weekend and wore it , loads of compliments , even from the sternest of airport security !
Efficient service .
From the website to the delivery easy to order and quick , efficient service .
Great place to shop + affordable prices !
I always enjoy shopping @ yesstyle.com , it 's super easy and affordable !
Fashion forward and they always have great deals .
Did what it said on the tin !
Best price and smooth service
Best price for the tyres which were fitted by a very diligent independent .
The fitting centre was not flashy but the guys were very competent unlike a recent experience at a major chain .... Would definitely use both blackcircles and the fitting centre MTMC in Tonbridge again .
Fast , on time service .
I ordered my lenses on Sunday , Tuesday I received them !
It was easy to order , so I will purchase from here again .
Not helpful at all .
I've ordered from these guys a few times , only to be disappointed by their customer service and slow shipping each time .
Exceptional service will definitely use again .
I had to call when we were on our way to the airport to give them an estimate of our arrival time .
We just followed the directions on the booking letter to the drop off point where the driver was already waiting for us .
We just empted the car ( Driver helped ) and he gave us a receipt and wished us a good holiday .
On return we phoned from the arrivals hall whilst waiting for our luggage ( which was very quick ) and by the time we walked to the pickup point our car was just pulling up for us .
Like I said it was an exceptional service , he also gave us the £1 coin to get through the barrier .
We will definitely use them again
Quality product , arrived in a timely manner !
Since I'm responsible for both vehicles in my family , and my time is valuable .
I don't mind spending a little extra for replacement parts . The part arrived in a timely manner .
Appears to be made of quality materials .
Living in Phoenix Az , where the temp will remain in the 100+ range for weeks on end .
Its important to install quality parts for your vehicles coolant system .
The parts came well packaged and on time !
Install was easy and fitment was perfect !!!!
Very satisfied with this transaction !

Got pre-qualified o er the phone .
So I knew what I had available for me to use for our have of new o e .
Went to toms river store at 8pm .
Had everything done and my new car home by 10pm ...
The best car buying experience I have ever had .....
They even allowed my to leave my enterprise rental car at store to be picked up next day !
Thanks to everyone and the team you have there .
I tell everyone about your company !
Love the concept and the service but the website isn't the easist to navigate
We have ordered several gift cards from GiftCards . com and they have all been just as described on the website .
Delivery is quick , most times within one week .
We would recommend this company to our friends .
The problem with the website is that when we click on a card to be placed in our shopping cart , when we go to the shopping cart there are sometimes six of the same card in the cart .
If we want multiples we will order the amount we want .
Good cusomer service on the phone ... when you can get them on the phone
I ordered a part and received it but it was the wrong one even though the correct part number was on the pick sheet enclosed .
When I called I waited for about 40 minutes and finally hung up .
Called again first thing the next day finally reaching a person who happened to be the one who processed my email complaining about the incorrect part .
He said he would waive the shipping and issue a free shipping label for the return part but that I needed to place the entire order again and he would process it and send it out US mail 2 day .
I was going out of town in three days and the typical shipping time for the other parts I ordered was only 2 days using regular mail .
I told him I didn't care how it was sent as long as I received it in two days , he said I should have no problem in getting it .
I left town 3 days later without receiving the part .
Turns out it didn't get mailed for a day and a half and is the reason I didn't get it in time and it still took 3 days to get to me , but I had a tracking number , LOL .
Ten days now and I still haven't received my refund either .... who knows when that will come .
Priceline prices is awesome love the rates of the hotel I suggest for everyone to use this web site
Very goog store
I bought an item that was out of stock .
Someone from the store called me to offer a better item , an upgrade of the one I had bought .
I was very satisfied with their attention and respect .
Penny grab tried and help me but it just seemed to complicated .
Maybe I'm just to excited for action .
Selection plus service equals awesome
Frames direct has the best selection and great service to go with it .
This is the only place I ever think about when I buy glasses .
Thanks frames direct
Smartest efficient direct language system

two thumbs up :)
allowed me to order a book that was out of stock .
Ordered and paid for a book on a Friday .
Received an email from them Tuesday saying the book was out of stock and they were cancelling my order .
The best part , it took 3 to 5 business days to refund my money .
Glad I didn't need it to purchase a book somewhere else .
great price and great service
I only wish I'd discovered bookbyte sooner ... would have saved a lot of money on my kids ' textbooks !
Large selection , good prices , and fast delivery .
As a home mechanic it 's so helpful to have a great selection of quality parts that arrive in a couple days .
Convienient , comfortable and neat .
I was only there from late in the evening ( 9:30 PM ) to early in the morning ( 8AM) .
It was really loud outside the dorm window ( a parking lot - loud people and cars coming and going all night) , and of course the freight trains rumble by every 30 - 60 minutes , so not much deep sleep .
I was okay cause the prior week I was sleeping on hard ground in the canyon .
The beds are comfortable , the dorms are well organized and welcoming , and you couldn't ask for a more " easy to get " place .
I did not participate in breakfast , but it is nice it is avaiable .
If I am ever in that neck of the woods again , I will stay there .
Easy to order online with quick delivery .
I loved how easy it was to order and when I compared prices , your filters were much less .
The order came quickly in a perfect box ( not a damaged box) .
Cat chows down on Chewy cat food !
Chewy.com 's pricebreaks and free shipping are terrific ; my order arrived with a speed that costs extra at other online sites .
I was impressed that the quality cat food I purchased at my local co-op was available at Chewy and with the convenience of front door delivery .
They offer the best prices , so to be honest I wasn't expecting too much , but the ink arrived promptly , and are very good quality .
I will definitely be buying from them in the future .
couldn't be faulted .
Great price and the delivery was excellent .
We needed some advice before bought this , and they were really helpful . we are really impressed with our Quooker .
first class service and product
I bought the guard dog alarm because I so it in USA but it only had 110volt system I live in Australia which is 240volts I so that the guard dog alarm was sold in U.K so I sent an email and got an almost instant reply which was fantastic and the rest as they say is history the compay that sent it was very very good it was posted same day and arrived 6 days later it works really well .
( a large dog came on my property the the electronic dog gave one bark and the large dog ran off , it is very realistic if a real dog is frightened off by it I highly recomend the product ) once you find the best position it works very well even through a11inch double brick cavity wall so I am delighted with it .
Very good very quick service .
Love my lights .
They've brightened up my garden !
Thinking of getting more ...
High quality products at reasonable prices .
Very pleased with the new DE razor I ordered .
It will last a long time .
i have to say that shopto.net is a great website i placed an order and got the goods the next day i will definatly be using the service again as the delivery was quick and i didnt have any problems with shopto.net great service
Great Price , Fast Delivery
Very happy with the product I purchased , installed it myself and now my blinkers work again .
Next time I need a part for a do-it-yourself fix , I will definitely check outPartsGeek first !
The people there are easy to work with .
There are various cars to choose from .
The people there were so friendly .
This is the second carpurxhased from drive time and I couldn't be happier .
Exactly what was described on web page
very fair price and a good product with a swift postal delivery , I hope to be buying more in the future ,
Super fast delivery - fantastic

fashionqueen.net is in bankruptcy !!!
This website is a SCAM !!
Since August 2013 i bought 4 bags for 4.800 € , which they never sent !!
I tried to contact them by email , they took so long to reply , and only to tell me they were available and going to send them .
so i waited… After a long while , i decided to cancel my orders and pick some other bags instead .
I did this 3 times from August 2013 to now , mid-february 2014 , more than 7 months !!!!!!
And i'm a good client , I spent more than 10.000 € in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered , even if it took 6 months for some !
But since August , whenever i sent them emails , when they replied ( half of my messages were never answered) , they gave me partial answers .
On the 29/0114 i asked them to send me the bags or let me choose some others instead .
They told me they cancelled the orders so i could pick something else .
They didn't reply until the 12/02 to tell me they would check again .
But i got sick of waiting so i asked my boyfriend , who is Italian , to have a look , as his father is a police officer and he knows people in Italy that could help me , so he called some governmental office to ask them about Fashionqueen . net , and guess what ?!
FASHIONQUEEN DOESN'T EXIST !!!
It is not registered , the P . IVA IT04222640239 doesn't exist !
My boyfriend wrote an email to fashionqueen to ask them to send me the bags and reply to the many emails i sent them , otherwise he would sue them in order to get a refund .
And guess again ?!
Here is the answer :

I had purchased a few knives , one of which was engraved , as well as a couple of sheaths .
The following day , I had an add-on order for a couple of paracord bracelets .
The gentlemen at Swiss Outpost were kind enough to combine the orders , thereby saving me an extra shipping cost .
But more importantly , this order left the east coast for the west coast with remarkable speed and arrived at my home in a most timely manner .
I applaud this fast and courteous service .
This is why I am a repeat customer .
My heartfelt thanks .
Brian P . Salmon
Very quick and clear
The whole process took less than 15 minutes and without any complicated sales talk .
Excellant site except for having to register your vehicle every time you log -on , DaH .
I like the site , a lot of parts available for my car , but I hate not having a personal vehicle register , You have to fill it out every time you look for parts .
Thanks Fred L .
Great service , good product and pricing .
My first time ordering it was pleasant and fast and the products were as represented will be ordering again .
Great service , great value , very pleased .

I was surprised at the arrival time , was very good.Y'all are in my Favorites list now .

That is the problem .
You have part number 72014 which is for the 2003 BMW 5-series sport wagon .
You need 71014 for the sedan .
Please contact PartsGeek and get them exchanged .

Dear Marty ,
Thank you for contacting MacNeil Automotive .
You obviously have the wrong part .
We would need the part number off the plastic sleeve the deflectors came in .
Is your BMW a sedan or Sportwagon ?
I will be happy to assist you once I receive the information .

Further update to the below message ....
Seems that kit #72014 is not the correct part for a 520i .
The rear shields are about 1 1/2 " too long to fit in the rear window channel .
See attached ...... I was just going to reorder the front driver 's visor but the rears will not work now either ..... Please advise ........

To whom it may concern :
Please refer to customer order #1620378 , transaction #388950 , package ID #5151788 .
I received my order today but will need to return the item for exchange .
One of the 4-pieces of the item is badly scratched and cannot be installed as existing .
The item was properly packaged and arrived intact but the product was probably scratched before being placed within the heavy plastic shipping sleeve .
Could someone please advise on return for exchange instructions ??

5% off price match
Customer Service is excellent and prices are great .
Using the 5% off price match tool is addictive !
My most trusted on-line store !
I have been dealing with Wiggle for nearly 10 years , never a problem !
The CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS
I tried to cancel a reservation , talked to two different people .
The guy basically hung up on me .
Very rude .
Didn't give a crap at all .
Truly surprised by excellent service
I ordered a water pump on sunday , expecting it to take 4 or 5 days to get to me .
Only two days later I received my pump .
I was happily surprised by the fast service and will come back in the future for other things .
Five Star Service
Once again the process has been easy , reliable and cost effective .
The appointment was met and our chosen garage were efficient as usual .
Excelente , recomendo !
Dont worry guys !
the service is actually very good !
they are the best !
Long Live CJS !
Excellent app and so easy to use !
This is one of the few apps that I would consider paying money for .
It is so easy to use and adapt it 's style to suit your own website design .
Also their support team is right on the ball with instant answers to any queries I had .
A flawless experience from staff to the actual car .
The experience began with the AutoEurope agent actually using Google Earth , in tandem with me , to see the actual location of the Lisbon Baixa office .
The rental transaction with off without a hitch .
The diesel BMW 1 hatchback was ideal for our needs , and because it was a Spanish licensed car , our one way drop fees were reduced .
The agent was helpful directing us out of Lisbon .
Checking in at Barajas airport , Madrid was effortless .
Again , the agent was most helpful arranging for transportation to our hotel .
Having been an Avis employee back when the " We Try Harder " campaign first began , yes we are talking 1963 , it was great to see the motto was alive and still meaningful .
Fast , reliable service
Well advertised products that arrive quickly
Fantastic as usual
Arrived within 1 working day in perfect condition as described
Did better than anticipated .
Got the Parts ordered in a very timely manner .
I got them so quickly I asked the UPS man if they had shipped them guaranteed 2 day .
Will definite order again when I need parts .
Transaction went smooth as silk
Beautiful product -- as advertised .
Extremeley fast delivery .
Perfect transaction .
Extremely efficient and quick service !
Cheap and reliable - would use again
Good reliable service at a fair price .
Used the service twice and received exactly what was promised .
Exactly what I ordered
This was exactly what I ordered .
It came when promised and was intact .
Couldn't be happier .
One of the hiring managers told me that I had the fanciest resume they had ever seen
The entire team at Onebuckresume was really great to work with .
I used their Executive-Classic Resume format and I have to admit I was a little concerned about it only being one dollar and all .
Prior to working with One buck , I had a dud of a resume that was getting no traction .
My career is challenging to describe and I had done a pretty poor job of it .
The resume builder quickly picked up on the positive trends of my career and the qualities about myself and what I was looking for that needed to be emphasized in the resume .
It did a great job .
The process was so easy , too .
Everything is done by the resume building platform so it 's very fast and uncomplicated .
They asked me to complete a fairly thorough questionnaire that really helped me reflect on my career .
Once that was done , I had a gorgeous resume as well as some cover letter and thank you letter templates .
I had a few minor revisions that I requested and those were done immediately , no questions asked .
Then , I hit the market .
The questionnaire coupled with the resume were great for prepping for the interview .
One buck resume tries to draw out " stories " during the process and it made it seem so natural to use these stories in the interview process .
I'm happy to say that I have a new job and t was both the resume and the way this site got me to look at my accomplishments from a different point of view that gave me the confidence to succeed .
If you're unhappy with your resume , check out onebuckresume.com .
One of the hiring managers I spoke to told me that I had the fanciest resume they had ever seen .
Great service from Environfone .
They sent the reply envelope very quickly and within a week had confirmed that the phone I was selling was good quality and in working order and within another week I had the cheque in payment .
Best sushi I've ever had !
Flash-frozen wild fish arrived perfectly frozen to my door !
I was dubious that it would make good sushi since it has been frozen for so long , but the salmon sushi was actually the best one I've ever had .
The salmon has a distinct intense red color that lets you know it 's far superior to the supermarket farmed ones .
I eat fish much more often now .
Thank you for providing such an excellent service .
I will definitely order again !
I was extremely pleased with the response from this company
Bought this guitar for my sons xmas present . He was amazed at the price and the quality of the product .
Smooth transaction and quick delivery .
Would definately recommend this company to anyone .
So far - lousy customer service
I did not receive confirmation of my order and i received some of the items in 3 different shipments .
I emailed customer service 3 days ago and have not heard from anyone .
I don't have a copy of my order and that is what I asked for .
Fast , efficient delivery .
Excellent priced products and great customer service .
Great product & speedy delivery !
All great products at a good price & were delivered in no time !
Would highly recomment purchasing from this site .
However i would not recommend allowing any of your friends/ family to " play " with any of the items as in my case , they will be spilled , smashed , shattered , lost or used to destroy other various items in the house !
If you are responsible and can read instruction then this site & it 's products are for you !!
Was a pleasure to do business =) also the friends/family i previously mentioned are all over the age of 25 ...... Trust no one !
Great Value and fast postage
Very happy with the price and super fast postage .
So much cheaper then tesco .
Fast order and delivery , would recommend to all my friends .
I have been very pleased with this company and would definately recommend them .
Stir fry crazy
Now my husband has no excuse to cook me a nice stir fry as he has the wok i bought for him .
We are very very pleased with it , my husband is a chef so he knows what is good and what is not , would definately recommend these people to others .
Many Thanks .
Satisfied buyer .

Can't bear the service .
Fast and easy , had my contacts the very next day .
great prices on good parts shipped fast
I like the prices on your parts and it only took 2 days to get them I am very happy with Parts Geek
A really excellent , customer-service oriented experience ; reliably delivering products on time .
While there were a few glitches at the beginning with uploading ( which were frustrating) , I understand the difficulties presented by moving large files .
There was always prompt communication and timely delivery of the transcripts .
Another thing ( harder to quantify ) is the high quality of the actual transcription .
The punctuation , accurate wording , and organization of the final transcript were extremely helpful .
Highly recommended .
Beautifully Easy !
I used Ava 's back in January .
I had to find the most beautiful flowers I could find and still be within a budget .
I had never purchased flowers from an online site before and I was very very nervous .
The Ava 's site offered good deals and extra savings for first time orders I had to take a look .
Unfortunately , I was making an order for a funeral for my very dear cousin .
I wanted the most beautiful I could find and Ava 's had a wonderful selection .
I was able to see what the flowers would look like and the order was easy to place .
The flowers showed up on time and were gorgeous just like the picture if not better .
I was very impressed and my family loved them .
Exceptional value and exceptional quality
Quick , easy , convenient and at a fair price .
We've used Global parking several times in the past few years and have found the internet site easy to use with a good variety of selections for parking .
price and service was good and delivery was very quick !
I bought a barbour gilet online .
The webiste worked well , good pictures etc and the price was betetr than anywhere else I could find on the net .
I ordered it and received it within 3 days so all in all a good buy and super service .
Good prices , quick delivery would use again
Excellent 5* Service
The service was faultless , 100% satisfaction
Fine - no problems
Luckily , I happened to be in when the delivery took place which was an added bonus .
Items were well packed and arrived safe and sound .
great prices and easy to use
Love your site great prices
SO DAMN FAST
I ORDERED PARTS ONE NIGHT AND A DAY LATER THE TRUCK PULLED UP WITH A BOX IN HAND .
NOW THIS TRUELY A FEAT SINCE THESE PARTS ARE FOR MY 1984 MERCEDES BENZ 300D
Generic parts not specific to my vehicle , will not get a refund .
Ordered an oxygen sensor for my car .
When it arrived it was approximately for my car but not an exact fit .
The connector was similar to mine but not exactly the same .
Had to be altered slightly to make it connect .
The original wire on my sensor was 6 " long .
The wire on your replacement was 24 INCHES LONG !
WHAT DO I DO WITH THE EXTRA WIRE ?
Since it was near the exhaust system there is an increased chance the wire could hang down and burn at some point even if it 's tied out of the way .
I bought this sensor intending to make the check engine light go out .
IT DID NOT GO OUT !
Is this because I replaced the wrong sensor or because your sensor is an incorrect replacement ?
We'll never know because this item is not returnable because it is an electrical part .
I guess I am going to just EAT IT and try another vendor .
This experience seemed like a good idea but it just didn't work out .
The best delivery service I have ever received !
I saw one of their delivery lorries on the motorway and have to admit I'd never heard of them before .
I visited their website and was surprised to see that they included negative comments as well as the positive ones as a lot of companies wouldn't do this .
This was obviously a company that were confident in the products they sold and the level of service they delivered .
The product range was excellent as well as the descriptions and the short videos were a fantastic idea .
I am just about to order a second item from them as I am sure the service will again be excellent .
True customer care
After dealing with a company with the efficiency of a dead cat , it was amazing to use GAK .
Speedy delivery and constant updates ( Y )
wrong parts slow shipping
The oarts do no match each other and dont fit my truck .
Im very unhappy
From WIMP to WOW in a few minutes
My friend , who usually does all our bookings , was unwell .
So it fell to me to attempt the booking of a hotel in Nottingham .
....... Was NOT fancying this task .
Anyway , got on line , Found a site , ( or did it find me )
After a couple minutes , there it was , just what I was looking for .
Pressed the correct keys , and BINGO all booked .
Thank you .
I now consider myself a computer whiz kid .
Prompt delivery , excellent product
Sent products as promised , fair price , no complaints .
I was very happy with friendly , excelent service and price was better than with other companies
I did my reservation late at night and was able to speak with a member that helped complete my transaction .
Quick delivery and affordable rental !
Fast shipping - reasonable prices
Would def buy from them again - received exactly what I ordered in a sooner than expected time frame - and the price was right !
Awesome ... from Canada
Got exactly what we ordered , good quality and good fit .
We cannot get these sizes in Canada and we appreciate your service !
Thanks and we'll be back again and again !
C . Conti , Ontario , Canada
Emergency funds when you need it !
I do not feel that my application is complete .
I did not receive a confirmation .
Resulting to having to
contact your support desk .
Easy Ordering !
I adore Skinfo . com !!
I cannot do without my EltaMD UV SPF 40 Tinted moisturizer .
It is one of the only tinted moisturizers that does not break me out on a hot day .
Best part is the ordering is a piece of cake .
No hassle and my product is here before I run out of my last one !
I would recommend this company to anyone .
Hope to deal with you again .
Thank you .
Exceptional service .
Ordered an amplifier online and it was duly delivered as promised .
However , the amp wasn't quite up to par ( I understand it 's gone back to Marshall to see if it 's faulty or just poor quality) .
long story short , amp was collected and a different one delivered with the minimum of fuss .
Received updates regularly regarding progress of the exchange , so I wasn't left hanging in limbo wondering what was going on .
I must give special thanks to Elaine for her help in the first instance and also a huge thank you to Dawn who dealt with the exchange .
Helpful and courteous all the way through , the sort of staff member who you should be able to get a transfer fee for if she was to leave .
Great stuff , wouldn't hesitate to recommend .
Great deal & speedy delivery .
What more could you ask ?

The best choice for online hostel bookings
Have used HostelWorld for travels all around the world (~15 countries) .
Have generally had very good experiences .
As with any site , you need to know what you are looking for and how to navigate .
And you always need to read hostel reviews with a grain of salt , and think about who wrote it and who might stay at that hostel ( a partier might give a party hostel 100% , but that doesn't mean you'd give the same rating if you're not a partier) .
Once you know how to navigate the site , it does quite well and in my opinion is superior to the other hostel sites out there .
A better map/compare feature would be helpful .
Overall , however , I've had good experiences .
I will not use Reservation Counter again
I thought I was calling the hotel directly , ended up making reservations for 3 rooms through Reservation Counter .
They took my money , could not deliver the rooms I reserved , and I stood at the front desk for 2 hours and 10 minutes ( so said the person behind the desk ) on the phone with Reservation Counter before they finally resolved the issue .
As I said before , I will not use Reservation Counter again !
I didn't like having someone try to get me to sign up for monthly deliveries .
Would have rated five stars if an operator didn't try to talk me into monthly shipments .
Great flivht company , fast , and true prices !
The price ypu see , it 's the price ypu pay , there is no taxes after ypu click buy , there is no change oc prices after the click because of the company flight !
Great and fair company !
It 's nice to find different places for office supplies .
There 's some items I found a little overpriced .
But I'm very pleased with what I purchased .
I will come back to your site when I need more supplies .
Right Materials ; Bad Shape
I only had to rent one book online , and my only option was Bookbyte .
I had researched reviews and for the most part everything was good so I went with it .
The shipping time was good , but when I got my book I wasn't too happy .
I knew that it would be a loose leaf book , but when I received the package in the mail they had the book on a much smaller binder ring than what was needed and some of the pages were tore off from the front and back .
I would have been okay with this if the information hadn't of said the book was in good shape .
The book wasn't missing any pages so luckily I have everything I need for class , but I did have to go out and purchase some items to fix the book to be able to use it in class without losing pages .
great prices ..
wish they had the shoes that I wanted available to buy
very disappointed about the item that was sent to me
We were not able to get to fix or look at the parts right away , when we recieved them and when it was a conveinent time , my friend took off my muffler and tail pipe , and went to put on the items I bought .
And they did not fit .
As a matter of fact , they were not even the right parts I ordered .
I was away in Florida at the time he was fixing my car .
I was not even able to get onto a computer to contact the company , regarding the parts .
When I returned home , I went online to look up the information about talking to someone or returning the items and getting a refund , and noticed there is a time limit for 30 days .
It was past the 30 days .
I did try calling several times , but no one answered the calls .
the person you have listed , Jennifer Quaglini is not the person who " bought the parts " I used her account to buy the car parts .
my name is sharon ledue
Big selection and quick shipping .
Quickscrew is convenient and thorough .
got to see the game from the side of stadium not the end
Glad I found Mr Chewy for supplying dog food !
Mr Chewy gives fast service on good brands of dog food at good prices .
It 's great to have a 30-lb bag of dog food delivered straight to home !
Fast free shipping and returns
My doctor advised me not to take a certain herb I had already ordered from Pure Formula .
Tis due to possible interaction of my chemo med and the herb .
I called and asked if I could mail it back and they sent me a prepaid return address label !
My orders are usually received within a couple of days after entering them on computer website .
They have large selections to choose from .
Great products at unbeatable prices with fast free delivery .
As a new customer , I am very pleased with PureFormulas .
They have all of the top brands that I need at the best price around .
Ease of purchase and prompt delivery with free shipping is much appreciated .
I will be recommending PureFormulas to everyone I know who purchases vitamin and mineral supplements .
Great and fast service !
From sending an online inquiry I had an actual person call me within 30 mins .
We discussed what I was wanting including a custom design .
I was sent a sample pack of the different opinion which was very impressive .
I received the artwork very quickly and the actual order within a week .
We have been sending our flash drives all over Australia and internationally and receiving great reviews from our customers .
I recommend using this company and I plan to use them for future orders .
Overall satisfied .
Timely shipping , good price , good quality
Rim was slightly scratched around the edges .
Not a huge issue , but a little disappointing .
Great Service good product
Finding myself running low on cartridges , I found the Cartridge Shop site .
Placed my order and without delay had it delivered .
You will have to go a long way to find better produce or price .
Will certainly recommend to others .

Nice to find a company that does what it says on the can
We decided to buy a new parasol , so I went on the web and came across the Garden Xl site .
Looked through all their items and found one we liked .
with a base .
Placed order , courier form kept us update and when delivered could not have asked for more pleasant and helpful lads ( even asked where we wanted it dropped) .
All I can say is that the pictures do not do the item real justice ( it looks far more expensive) .
More than satisfied with service and will certainly be back .
ShopTo is SpotOn !
shopto is great , they're quite often the cheapest I've seen for new games and a lot if the time if you preorder a game it'll come a couple days before release .
Top service .
Will be using again .
I didn't expect to get next day delivery at the time I ordered .
Pleasantly surprised to see that option at such a reasonable price when completing my order .
As soon as this protein runs out I'll be ordering more .
Thank you for your service !!
Inexspensive name brand eyewear and fast delivery , what great combination .
The same glasses at the optical shop I went to was over $400 , got them for almost half price at Frames Direct .
I have a very strong prescription so the savings are amazing .
Would gladly recommend to friends and family .
Find out what you need to know on The Shower Doctor
I was delighted to find the Shower Doctor , on an internet search engine , because the site answered all my questions , regarding a faulty Triton , I then ordered and received the parts , I required , all within a few days , unfortunately , one of the parts I needed was obsolete , so was unable to fix the problem , but without my access to the shower doctor , I wouldn't have had , the info I needed .
So in conclusion .
The Shower Doctor is the place to be , if you want the trusted info to buy parts , or replacement shower , everything is explained , in an informative and simple way , together with video 's of the relevant repairs , or fitting .
satisfied with order but upset about the delivery
i am very satisfied with the medicines i have order and the prices are great but this has been the second time when i have paid for quicker delivery and my order has arrived in a later date .
I recently paid $ 6.99 for a 3 day shipping and received the order 4 days later .
That is out saturday , sunday and monday which was a holiday .
I called and the operator said something does is not advertised with the price .
That according to her they don't count fridays which is a working day .
I was not impressed or satified with the answer .
First time trying this online store .
Easy to navigate the website , and lots of free stuff .
Shipping is a little pricey but the product prices are excellent .
Definately buy molarclean as its a good quality product and excellent value for money !
no booking fuss just right for us
easy to book and all information plain and understandable thank you .
4th order from this company .
Very reasonable prices , with very quick delivery .
Would def .
recommend to others
Fast and convenient .
I have never failed to find what I'm looking for , even specialty items .
The prices are competitive or less than my local medical supply store .
Shopping from my comfortable chair is so much easier than driving all over town .
Delivery time is prompt .
I have been doing business with this company for several years and am a completely satisfied customer .
Great service and product
Very happy with the wheel I ordered , like new , and received it within three days .
Very satisfied .
Fast shipping and product exactly as described .
Ordered two side mirrors and they came within 4 days and were exactly what I wanted .
The only complaint I have is that I never received a confirmation email when my order shipped , and I had to confirm the shipment by looking up the order number .
The commute to work continues !
When the bottom bracket failed on my cycle home , I was tempted to throw my bike in the shed & forget about it !
But then I decided to look online for a new one , but when I saw the price of a new Shimano XT Chainset on the Merlin Cycles website , I decided to treat myself & placed the order !
Bearing in mind this was about 9 o'clock Monday night - imagine my surprise to receive the package Wednesday morning !
The parts where fitted before elevenses & I was out to play , I mean , test it in the afternoon , then back on the commute Thursday .
Great place to buy from .
I purchased my fan on ebay ( auction number 170619352551) , February 12th and received it on the 15th .
Great packaging , fast shipping and fair prices .
Will use again .
painless and quick
I always use boiler juice because it is effortless
Waited far too long over 40 mins each time we got off the bus , had to phone twice .
Each time we got off the bus we had to wait over 40 mins for the next one to arrive , I had to phone twice to see where they were to be told there had been an accident and were trying to get to us .
The original bus tour managed to get through and 6 buses passed us while we waited for one , it was very very cold and wasted so much of our time very dissapointed .
Quickly delivered and well packaged
Always a pleasure to deal with Made . com .
They provide good communication on the status of the item delivery date .
Tennisnuts provides a fantastic and fast service .

As a result , I have recommended the website to lots of tennis friends .

I highly recommend working with them !

Amazing Customer Support and Super Fast Delivery
This company is awesome .
They are very helpful on the phone and after sales support is the best I've ever had .
I would totally recommend them and will be using them in the future , for sure .
I bought a pixma pro 100 , it arrived the next day , but had a fault .
I rang the company and they had a courier come and collect it the next day ( while bringing my new perfect printer) .
Very happy with my purchase and the service Park Cameras provided .
Site has gotten much better
I have been a monger since the 70's, and my massage experience has never been better since massage parlor reviews hit the internet .
Since I first became a member about 7 years ago I loved the site .
Around 2005-2006 , the site got a little sloppy and the speed was just average .
I left for a while and came back , and they have really tightened the functionality of the site .
The speed is much faster , I am able to view many more profiles in less time .
The reviews are very detailed now , many average 2-3 paragraphs .
They have added some creative features as well .
Overall , it took them a few years , but now it 's a winner .
No complaints whatsoever !
Loved the shirt and so did my boyfriend .
Quick efficient service too !
Fast and reliable
A great product delivered quick and hassle free , great place to shop
CHEAP PARTS . CANT BUY IT AT THE AUTO PARTS FOR THAT
Brilliant service super speedy pick up
Filled form online , printed out label and a couple of hours later parcel picked up , brilliant service for the low price paid .

No doubts this is the best site for booking hostels .
Perfect tool to find places .
The service was efficient and to the point .
I let my property via Rentify .

One word to discribe is Awesome

Lots of choice , very reasonable prices .
Good service although it took a week to tell me the glasses I had ordered were out of stock .
Very pleased when the glasses arrived .
Great service , great products , great company .

Horrible service !!!
Don't buy anything from this company !
Say yes to style !
I love this site .
It offer a varieties of clothing , shoes , accessories , beauties , and etc .
Everything is just so cute .

I got it in about 3 days !
No problems , whatsoever !
Straightforward and efficient process
i will recommend B&H without any hesitation .
the web site is great and in-person shopping is excellent as well .
i had an opportunity to visit the store in NYC and had a great experience - Joshua was extremely helpful and knowledgeable ...
Always top rated sellers .
Fast shipment everytime .
For those of you who have had bad experience with this company , I suggest you try gojane .
They have all the same stuff for cheaper , and it 's legit .
I know because I've shopped there for over a year now and even when I was stationed overseas in Europe , my packages always arrived within at least three days , 5 days max .
Glad I've read these reviews .
Thanks for the info .
I was literally one click away from loosing $200 .
Amazing Prices and Product
I've been searching everywhere for a toner for my printer .
After browsing everywhere , I found that this site had the lowest price .
Ordering went smoothly and product came quickly .
I would recommend this website to anyone .
Hi All ,
We were very pleased with Mazuma 's reliability and they were very prompt - results within a couple of days .
We would have liked to receive more money according to the age , and condition of the phone .
However the service and trust cannot be faulted .
We would definitely recommend this service to anyone .
Great product at a bargain price shipped fast .
The stylish faucet knobs looked too good to be true at the low price , but I'm glad I took a chance .
They look even better in person and were delivered quickly in strong but environmentally friendly packaging .
I will definitely be ordering more from Hudson Reed .
Would like to know status
The shopping experience was good ; however , I have not received updates .
The last I received was a week ago stating it was being processed .
It would be nice to know when it is shipped , and a tracking number .

Delivery on time , very professional company .
One issue with a part on the product I purchased .
I bought a Cross-Trainer and Body Shaper machine from this company and they were very professional .
The items arrived on time , at the time they stated , and the delivery person was polite and courteous .
They phoned beforehand to advise on the time of delivery .
The items arrived in good condition , and the packaging was not damaged .
I have one issue with a small part on the Body Shaper I purchased , but I hope this will be resolved soon .
Shopping was easy and Fast !
Ecomfort was so easy to find what I needed and place my order .
The shower system I ordered was a good price and shipping was free .
Everything arrived very quickly and had no damage .
It was much easier then trying to order at a local store .
I recommend Hostels . com to everyone
I've never been dissapointed by Hostels . com , especially when compared to other hostel booking sites .
Convenient and Informative
The site is easy to navigate and has a large number of hostels with informative reviews for each city in which I traveled .
It is nice to search based on price or rating , as well as to sift through ratings by date and number of stars given .
Excellent range , excellent service !
I wanted a small , UK legal knife but wanted something a bit more flash than a Swiss Army .
This fits the bill , inspite of the ' made in China ' stigma , it 's a good product and is reasonably priced .
Makes shopping a pleasure rather than a chore !
I like using wowcher because I enjoy the diversity of the products that they have .
The one thing I would say , which isn't anything to do with the company itself but rather the companies that use them , regarding things like jewellery , they don't turn up packaged very well there by casting doubt on the authenticity of the product they are selling .
it would be good if the sellers gave an option to box your goods or not even if they charged a little more .
I have ordered a few items of jewellery for gifts and each time felt disappointed that they had arrived in little plastic bags as opposed to if I had bought them at a shop .
But that issue isn't with Wowcher because they are awesome !
Helpful , affordable and fast delivery
I have been looking into getting a ductless system for quite some time .
I finally found eComfort 's website , and they had exactly what I wanted .
I had tried to get the units here in town , but was told I had old part numbers and quoted a system that wasn't even close to what I had spec'd out .
EComfort had exactly the units I had wanted , and at a great price .
I ordered it on Thursday , the 18 wheeler pulled in front of my house Wednesday to drop it off .
one word GREAT
i highly recommend petflow to everyone moving in 20 days back to california and will order auto delivery use orijen for diabetic dog great workes well told the vet never heard of it
Wowcher with an !
Excellent Wowcher Recommend it to Friends !
I have discovered Wowcher , it has become a life saver for special offers .
It varies from exceptional beauty offers , to day trips ( that otherwise would not have occurred to me ) to dining out .
I strongly recommend you look it up on the net .
A numerous amount of my acquaintances happen to share my opinion .
Have a look and sign up for good deals .
Look after yourself and I look forward to your point of view please .
Such an easy service to use
I decided to change my sons name 's to my married name and this service made it hassle free .
Within 2 days , I had the papers delivered and had no problems at all .
Great service !

Always been satisfied with Priceline .
I have been dealing with Priline for a good three or four years and so far have always been satisfied . Never a bad surprise when I check in the hotels .
Great customer service and easy process !
I placed my order while traveling and needed to change the shipping address prior to the order being shipped .
I sent an email and customer service had it handled within hours .
I received the shipment at the location I wanted and within a short timeframe .
Fast delivery and excellent customer service
Order came next day .
Exchange product was handled well
Communication - What is that
From the start to the delivery this is what we got - it was a lesson for other companies .
It also is a confidence booster for buyers on the internet .
MONEY FOR ME
Great prices on high quality products makes Supplement Warehouse a leader in the business .
The great prices at Supplement Warehouse allow me to make excellent gains in the gym on a shoestring budget .
I'm speding 40% less on supplements than I was at GNC " with the 20% gold card discount ".
On my last order , I purchased $ 250.00 worth of supplements for $ 107.00 plus $ 8.00 shipping , for a total of $ 115.00 .
Extra money in my pocket and an outstanding physique under my shirt ......... It makes good sense !!
Thanks Supplement Warehouse
Correct diagnosis of a problem --- the secret of a successful outcome .
My Mira Sprint was not producing hot water , flow and ON/OFF ok . Read the problems and solutions advice forums , downloaded the circuit diagram , did a couple of continuity tests and resistance measurements , made a conclusion , ordered the part required ( at a good price in comparison to other suppliers ) , fitted it in and all was well .
Many thanks to Shower Doctor .
Dan Mcgready .
PS : Saved £ 150.0
Results good - communication not so much
Ordered product and never received an email acknowledging purchase or subsequent tracking details .
Calls to the company were met with call holding usually resulting in the call timing out ( still trying to get the song out of my head) .
Finally , did get a guy on the phone and he was very helpful but never got an email or anything .
The part did show up and it was the as ordered at the best price I found online so I ultimately happy with the result .
I would not hesitate to buy here again .
Great service from a company I have been purchasing from for over 10 years

I have never had any issues with the products supplied by MemoryC .
They stock a wide range of memory products .
The delivery options are great .
I have no reservations about recommending MemoryC
Everything went so smooooothly in ordering , receiving and even installing my 2004 Passat Grill Insert ( with fog) , that I almost forgot all about the hideous speed bump that popped my old grill insert out of my car and into the middle of the street .
I think the best compliment you can give a supplier is forgetting about the ordeal that compelled you to seek them out in the first place .
Great service , worked like a charm , timely , and no complications !
These guys delivered what they promised .
Fast delivery at Low Prices
I found ShopTo a few years ago when I'd had enough of the more popular online game shops either being too expensive or just plain terrible with customer service .
They are one of the cheaper stores and they don't punish you for their low prices by charging for a decent delivery time , first class postage is free and most of the time if you order before 5PM you'll have the game the next day or if you pre-order a game you usually get it a day or two early as they want to make sure you get it by the release date .
I definitely would , and in fact have , recommend ShoTo to anybody , I use them for 99% of my gaming purchases and have never had a problem with them .
very very pleased with the service !
I was very pleased with my parts
also the service was great will order more part in the future .
Fast and easy !
I needed a gift card for a friend ASAP , so I was fortunate to find the PC Games Supply site !
I was able to buy the gift card and email it to my friend immediately .
I'll probably shop at PCGamesSupply . com again whenever I need more gift cards .
Always a treat ordering from Country Attire Ltd .
May Be Oldies But Are Definitely All Goodies
On Cyber Monday , I ordered the DVD set of " Have Gun Will Travel ", Volumes 1-5 .
After extensive shopping - via the web - Oldies offered the best price .
Have been a frequent buyer at Oldies . com and their prices are Always Lower Then The Competition .
Delivery is prompt with the added incentive of Free Shipping after a set dollar amount .
Its either shop / buy at Oldies . com OR expect to spend more money if you go elsewhere .
If you have the Best - in Oldies . com - you don't need the rest .
Timely service .
I only wished they included a discount for veterans as well as active duty .
Wink wink ..
The Primal Bells rock the Gorilla and I are going a couple rounds this afternoon .
speedy delivery as usual
Their products are resonably priced , packaged securely , and delivered on time .
I have nothing to complain .
Service was great !
I ordered flowers late in the US for a next day delivery , and they were on time and absolutely beautiful .
Great place to shop and great checkout
I have been purchasing from BH Photo for years .
I would love to visit the store in NY sometime , bet it is as great as the online store .
I especially like the online app for IOS .
Great service !
Very good website , great prices and overall service .
Good job !
Package not secured .
I received the 33# bag of dog food and the outside carton was 3/4 open at the top .
There was not sufficient tape across the top to secure the box considering the weight inside .
The bag of dog food could have fallen out .
Other than this , your service was very good and delivery was fast as promised .
Satisfied Customer !
I am very satisfied with my purchase and the help I received .
I will use your service , AFEyewear in the future and recommend to others .
Fast delivery and brilliant products at a very reasonable price .
Brilliant would recommend to anyone .

Package was delivered in a ver sturdy box with insulating foam and ice bloacks inside so meat was very cold when I got it .
One of my worries was the quality of the meat but after cooking rumps , whole chicken and diced turkey I can say that it is not a problem at all .
Very very good value for a very good quality product .
I won't be buying any more meat from supermarkets again .
Lowest prices , fast shipping !
Very easy to place an order .
They were the lowest price I can find online , plus it was free shipping .
Shipping time was pretty quick .
Order was accurate .
Will buy from them again !
Easy and pleasant shopping
Great online buying experience .
Everything is very straight forward .
No fuss very easy to order on line .
Great service !
Matched competitor price after the purchase was already made !
Got my shed kit within a few days !
Dream come True
I've been waiting forever for a site that is affordable , trustworthy and expeditious .
This site provides EXACTLY the services they say they will provide .
In each case I had to wait only mere hours before the services were provided .
their explanations and instructions were fast and very easy to follow .
I have already recommended them to everyone of my friends , because of their affordability , excellent service .
Their use of PayPal is a REAL plus as pay pal is a sure bet for excellent service .
I give it Five+ Stars .
Well Done !
Fantastic Delivery Service !
Ordered 3 mechanical pencils in the afternoon , arrived next morning !
Can't get any better than that and the prices were very competitive too !
Great products and super fast delivery !
Have bought from Festive Lights several times .
The quality of their products and very fast delivery means I always come back to them .
As usual great service !
I very highly recommend screencontry.com for their service , price and speed of deliver y.I have ordered many replacement screens and never had a problem with any . Also notice they now carry tablet and phone screens as well and the prices look reasonable .
Its great , simple and easy to use and quick delivery
Its such a easy site to use and recommend it .
this site is brilliant , the delivery is super speedy and also very easy to use .
Giant Vintage are the best !
Fast and friendly service .
Great products !

Fast delivery and got exactly what I ordered !
Love Parts Geek !!!
I needed to find a part for my air conditioner on my Wolfsburg Jetta and it was very easy to find the part , place the order and give feedback for my experiance .
I will continue to use Parts Geek until the cheap prices run out !!!!
Thanks Parts Geek !
First time ive used them for the Mass effect collecters edition after game announced they were no longer stocking .
Wont be using game again .
Im switching over to these guys from here on in
A great company to deal with .
We have always found the staff at Cleverboxes to be friendly , approachable and knowledgeable .
The company is very efficient and in the three years we have been dealing with them we havent had any issues , they have always been a pleasure to deal with ,
Fast and efficient
I wasn't expecting such a quick delivery .
Item arrived in good condition , and it was packaged really well .
Hello , Car rental counter .
Where are you ?
Signage in Rome Airport for the location of the rental office is sorely lacking .
Took us quite a bit of wandering and inquiry to get to the rental office .
Once there the staff took care of us very well and had us on our way .
Likewise , returning our car to Rome Train Station was a BIG headache .
There was no apparent sign for rental car return .
Had to park , go inside the terminal , find the office , retrieve the car and drive it to the appropriate area where I was instructed to just " double park " the car and lock it and bring the keys inside .
No receipt for the car was given .
Completely different experience than returning a car in Frankfurt where they went over the car with a fine tooth comb .
Italians vs . Germans
Speedier than a ...
... really fast thing .
The service and delivery speed was amazing .
Delivered beyond their promise !
Great products for a terrific price !
This site has lots of great stylish products - clothes , accessories , shoes , jewelry , makeup , and extremely reasonable prices .
Shipping is always quick and not too expensive .
Lots of compliments on the items I've bough from this site !
Will definitely shop here again .
loved everything !
Excellent quality at affordable prices !!!
Fast shipping will definitely order again !
Human Excellence !
Jed fully explained all my questions so easily and readily !
I'm looking forward to ZipRecruiter finding my next amazing employee ; and I trust ZipRecruiter is as amazing is the people they hire .
Thank you Jed !
High mileage vehicles that are over priced and poor quality .
Not a happy customer !!
Delivered correct part quickley .
Provided tracking and delivery updates to keep me informed
Part price was lower than other stores seen for the same part and the online help tool provided me an easy to use tool to order the right part .
Shipping method was ok but not the most cost effective method .
Product turned up as described and in perfect condition .
Prompt confirmation , dispatch and delivery of ordered items .
I received quick and reliable service while purchasing a rixty card code .
realy fast , perfect !
realy fast , perfect !
Best Prices .... But need customer service !
We use partsgeek every week , and they almost always have the best price anywhere .
However , if you do have a question , or problem with a part it is impossible to get in contact with anyone .
Over hour long wait times on hold , and emails do not get returned ... Customer service would make this parts supplier unbeatable !
Fast and reliable
The best cdkey webshop i've found so far .
Excellent webshop .
This cd-key webshop , is an excellent shop .
I am using this shop for several months now , I never had any issues or misunderstandings .
This is a good retailer ,
Daan Verbokkem - Nemesis_NL
Used many times-never let me down .
Recommend this company to anyone .
I always book with them-they've never let me down .
! Low prices n great delivery time ...
It was my first time order on the web .
The response I received from you guys was GREAT !!
You had exactly what I needed and received it promply ... I never trusted ordering by the web but have full confidence on your products and prices ..
NOT HAPPY AND DID NOT GIVE US CORRECT INFORMATION .
We booked holiday Inn Express in Custer City , SD on May 27th and May 28th .
The reservation said refundable .
Operator did not tell me that cancellation will cost me one day of booking .
I could not cancel it because of one day of booking fees .
The facts should have been presented to me at the time of booking .
Great customer service .
Great price and I received the item sooner than I expected .
Thank you .
Excellent Service and Prompt Delivery
Within 10 minutes of ordering delivery details were emailed and text to me and a one hour window supplied for delivery .
Just wish all companies were this effective .
Excellent Product , Excellent Service , Excellent All Round .
Very impressed with service and price .
I have rated 5 stars as I do feel it is an excellent website , overall customer service and price .
However .... I specifically wanted a service that provided installation as I am a single parent with a slight disability .
My old washer had began vibrating and making noises and as I felt this was due to it no longer being level I asked the installers to make sure that the new washer stood level .
Obviously they were rushing and simply said that I would need to sort that out myself and get a board to put underneath !
A neighbour later kindly adjusted the feet of the washing machine so that it stood level .
This was a service that I thought I had already paid for .
But overall I would recommend the site and would definitely use it again .
Could not ask for a better service .
Would recommend to everyone !
Quick shipping , great vinyl options
Quick shipping , great vinyl options
Ecigwizard is a very good partner
I've been very satisfied to co-operation with Ecigwizard .
Shippings from UK to Finland works well , the goods are excellent , just what I have expected .
There has been no cause to any reclamations .
I have no reason to complain about anything .
Great service !

Found suitable on website , paid with pay pall .

THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST BAR NONE !
I found this dive shop online when I was looking to purchase a new BCD .
I contacted their staff and they were very knowledgeable about the product I was looking at online .
The staff has been great I have had to call them several times for questions I have had about my new BCD .
They told me when and what was shipping and it was 100% correct to the day .
I had a great experience with this company .
I have since ordered more items from this company and I look forward to purchasing many more .
I have told many fellow divers about this store and their service they are excited to find a new sorce to purchase quality gear with great customer service .
Thanks again Tony C .
The only place in UK where I can buy my favourite drink
I have been trying to buy Minttu in the UK since the stock I brought back from Sweden three years ago ran out !
Just by chance when I was browsing the internet I found it at Whisky Exchange .
An excellent service , and remarkable quick delivery time .
Thank you !
No one does this better
Amazing service ... fast and easy ... why would you use anything else
Perfect delivered on time without any hassle
Perfect delivered on time without any hassle
Shopping made easy
I wanted a bulk order of compost and nobody seemed to want to deliver online , Homebase did so I will always use them in future .
The delivery came at 7.30 and the driver was very nice , put the delivery where I wanted him to .
ok if you are certain of what you want
I ordered a light fitting for undershelves in our study , I quoted the exact number on the fitting but when it arrived it was not compatible possibly having been modernised over the years .
On closer inspection of the site , there are items which state not compatible but this was not stated on my item .
I therefore returned it paying the postage and yet the postage was still deducted .
Although it was returned eventually I felt if this happens everytime some customers may not bother claiming back the postage !
I would be reluctant to use the site again in view of what has happened to me .
Arrived very quickly from France , were just what we needed and were very easy to program .
too long to come
The dresses were great but waiting ten days for online delivery at £ 3.99 was too long compared to other sites which can do next day or a few days delivery for free .
very good service
the item was delivered in good condition in 7 days .
i love a deal with free shipping .
got enough canned food to last my dog for a year or so .
Ethical company with great value and high quality products
I have recently started using Enliven Coconut Body Butter .
I purchased this product because I had recently read about how good coconut is for the skin , and for a while I had been looking for a natural coconut moisturiser which was not tested on animals and which did not contain too many added chemicals or artificial ingredients .
The Enliven body butter was the only product I could find which met all my criteria and it was really good value too - much cheaper than similar products .
I have now been using it for about a week and it is a beautiful product .
It smells great and it glides onto my skin , leaving it silky smooth .
I love this product , shall continue to use it and recommend it to all .
Quick fast delivery in time for Christmas !
Was not expecting my item to be delivered on time so much appreciated for this as it was Christmas present .
Very quick , friendly and professional service .
Overseas delivery over the weekend .
Very satisfied .
Awesome service , easy and fast .
I would buy from Function 18 again .
great service & great product
Delivery was very quick and on time , liked receiving the email with exact delivery time slot .
Product very easy to put together & seems to be working very well so far !
The website was very easy to use .
My order came within one day of placing my order and I was given a time slot when it would be delivered .
Highly recommend using this website !
This was my first experience of ordering oil via the internet ~ I need not have worried as the oil was delivered well in time ... so quickly that my tank did not get as low as I thought .
Even the refund for the over-payment was easy to handle !
Thank you BoilerJuice . com !
Quick and polite .
Quick service with great customer after-sales service .
Very helpful and always willing to help .
parts arrived as stated and in decent condition .
will use Partsgeek again
Price was lower than all others and quality was acceptable
Great customer service , great candidate results !
So far , we've had a great experience with ZipRecruiter .
After a misunderstanding about a discount code we were given , we were given a 30 day pilot that has been very successful .
We are seeing quite a few good candidates , which is always what we're aiming for with postings .
Zip is definitely a good buy for the money !
Service was great !
Petflow is reliable and efficient !
I have used other online companies to autoship pet food and treats etc .
but none come close to beat out Petflow 's pricing and speed of delivery .
They often offer trials from suppliers at deep discounts for us to try .
Would definitely ( and have ) recommend this company to family and friends
Fantastic trading experience for my first time , thank you very much , will certainly trade again .
good vitamin webstore
Easy to order & free shipping no matter how big or small your order is .
Lots of name brand vitamins at a good price .
The orders are always correct and the products are of high quality .
I have never had to return any products because of order error .
The products are excellent quality .
Delivery is quick and efficient .
Pure Formulas is an excellent company to do business with .
Thank you for making the impossible possible
Liked the site , walked away because of the shipping costs .
Would have bought from PartsGeek in a heartbeat until I saw the shipping costs .
Was only purchasing smaller type items and found the shipping costs too high .
Good place if they figure out a way to make shipping for smaller items more reasonable .
No complaints , product came fast and shipping info was sent to my email so I could track .
Is hard to believe that you will not take prepaid visa card .
Whats the difference on a regular visa card funds .
this would have been a great place to purchase parts .
I called customer service several times I was not able to get service waited over an hour to talk to someone .
I am confident I get the best deals through Priceline !
The greatt deals obtained through Priceline are literally what have kept me from absolute homelessness .
I lost my job in October 2012 and am able to survive this way as rents any other way are too high .
Smilebox allows me to personalize photos in a special way .
There is a custom format for every occasion , presenting every experience in a fun and expressive way .
Quick to deliver and good quality
Liked the magnets and the ferro liquid !
WIll make a good Christmas present for my Dad !
Awesome experience !
Odering was very easy and I received my product very quickly with no problems .
The product I ordered was just as described .
I would definitely order from this company again !
no customer service - nobody answers to phone for customer service - never agian
I purshased a part , and after i purshased it ( 5 min later i need to canx ) found out it was the wrong part ( received Email from parts geek) .
Call customer service - no answer , the only correspondence was through Emails ( which took days) .
Part was shipped - i had to send back " return ot sender ".
This is a very unprofessional way of doing business
Great , prices all parts fit no problems .
I am going to order parts for my pk .
Fast Turn Around
I made the recording and submitted it at night when I woke up it was in the inbox on my computer with no errors highly recommend for their fast and accurate service will definitely use them on future projects
Timely and Professional Service at a Great Price
PartsGeek . com is an excellent source for DIY car repair parts .
I ordered a replacement passenger door handle for my 2000 Ford Mustang , the order was filled the same day , and I got my handle in just over a week .
Excellent service by return of post !
Just found the replacement part of our obsolete shower .
Now back in good working order !
Thank you !
Good Price fast delivery .
Second time I ordered parts , Happy price and delivery .
The only thing better than lenstore would be corrected vision !!
It 's so easy to just log on to the site and choose to refill your order in a click !
There 's this massive range off lenses whether 's its dailies or monthlies and you can have a good read and decide what 's best .
It 's fab if you fancy a change and want a wee browse of what else is out there .
The prices are super compared to the monthly subscriptions to opticians and much more flexible .
I've never had a problem with lenstore .
The order always arrives in about 2 days from ordering .
Simple trouble free transaction
Trouble free order , arrived in good time , well packaged & arrived safely
Wrong color we ordered the blue and received the green one .
Objects in mirror really are closer than they appear
I got the passenger side mirror for my 2009 Hyundai Sonata because the one I had was broken from an incident that happened while backing out of my garage .
This was a perfect fit .
It took about 5 minutes to completely replace it .
The only issue is it is black but I can get paint to get it to match if I really need to do that .
I got the product quickly and it seems to be a good after market condition part .
Fast , easy , simple , and reliable !
We've been ordering Dasuquin from these guys for a little over a year .
Every time , our re-orders are easy , simple , cost-effective , and arrive on-time .
Great way to see London in a day
The guides were friendly and informative .
We had a great time on the tour bus .
We got to see all the sights in a very limited amount of time .
Unfortunately , it does not stay in place .
It 's made with a great material , but it doesn't stay in place .
One of the plugs was out of it 's box due to the poor packaging .
The items were able to rattle around in the box because the wrapping paper was on the bottom of the box and the parts were put in on top with a lot of extra room .
This allowed the parts to rattle in the box
They always deliver !
I always trust the staff here that they will take care of me and my truck.I've been coming here for over 20 years and always recognize the faces . Extremely courteous , knowledgeable and helpful .
Excellent booking experience !
Keep up the good work !!
Great products quick delivery I recommend American RV for part supplies
products as advertised in original design and packaged well
A very easy means of communication .
But if you can make the rates slightly cheaper , it would definitely be wonderful .
very good fast service
the website was easy to use and i was very impressed by the speed of service
Confused but reliable
Apart from confusion over delivery dates , the website said one date and my text message said another date , service was good .
As always , prompt and efficient .
Needed parts in a hurry , easy to locate on website .
Placed order goods delivered within two days .
Polite , prompt , efficient .
Good product knowledge , polite reply to enquiry , prompt despatch and delivery .
Fast , easy and awesome !
Fast , easy and awesome !
Better than handing them in at a mobile store for Recycling .
Always have what I need , great prices .
Shopping at B&H is easy , with great prices and good selection .
Spot on service at lighting speed
Had the correct part in stock and was with me the very next working day .
5 stars !
Very knowledgeable , helpful and quick
They helped with any questions and sent the part out which was with me very quickly .
Write a catchy header to make your review stand out

Worked quickly and efficiently .
Polite and and would recommend
Quick , efficient and value for money .
Had a relatively simple problem to resolve on my power shower , although I anticipated the age of the shower ( 15 years old ) may have caused a few problems .
Required a replacement dial on the front of the unit , which meant I couldn't turn it on or off .
Contacted Shower Doctor by phone and they managed to source one for me .
Part arrived next day and I'm back to happy showering , well at least not having to take a pair of pliers into the shower with me to turn it on and off .
I cannot fault there service in anyway and would definitely recommend them .
Overall a good free service ...
We heard about Consumers Advocate on the local news in a segment on pet insurance .
So I jotted down the URL , did some digging around on the interwebs & , while we could've used a bit more help comparing specific plans , the site was helpful , & we were impressed by how accurate the information on the site was .
It was kind of like using Yelp , minus the food pictures & long winded review rants , which , as a self-proclaimed foodie myself , I actually really appreciated .
ship in a timely fashion , and 9 times outta 10 the lowest prices
Massively helpful to see the variety
I find the site great and really helpful , they give you such a range and you can see everything that 's available in one go .
I find the reviews really good too .
I think the only difference to be made is that they could do with trying to get ALL the hostels from areas on it , as some places like Lornes YHA isn't on there , so if people don't know what they're looking for there , they may think there isn't a hostel at all .
Aside from that , good amount of information and presentation .
Good Experience with Saratoga Wine Folks
Saratoga Wine Exchange 's online wine ordering came off without a hitch and in fact , was delivered ahead of schedule .
The wine was available through a distrbutor warehouse and arrived early in Saratoga .
They shipped it out to me here in Michigan , the same day and it arrived two days later by noon .
I haven't tasted the wine yet , as I generally wait close to a month ... allowing the wine to acclimate and settle after the Fedex road journey halfway across the country .
But , since the weather was not extreme , I don't expect any problems .
Searching for wines is a nationwide exploration nowadays ... especially if you're cost-conscious .
Saratoga meets the test of being a saavy and sophisticated player in this highly-competitive market .
I'll be back !
[ link ] can't deliver unless an adult is home to sign .
I can't be home to sign ( work) .
Can't have delivery at work ( teacher) .
Shipper won't allow neighbor to sign with my permission and signature .
[ link ] is holding the package for 5 days at their facility .
That 's 30 minutes away and I haven't been able to get off work early enough to get there for the last three days .
I ordered this for Mothers Day but may not get it in time .
Understand the rules , but this whole thing has been very difficult .
I would like to change to a new address ( where a friend can take it ) but [ link ] says no .
Not satisfied .
I CLICKED TO ORDER AND FOLLOW UP AND DELIVERY WERE ALMOST AS FAST AS MY CLICK .
THANK YOU .
My order of two brown glazed garden stools was followed up quickly with very caring respectful e-mails .
Delivery was very prompt and my order arrived perfect in very well packaged boxes .
Awesome pawsome !!!
I ordered a collar led light and a Grammy 's treat for my dog Scarlett Grace .
Petflow shipped our stuff really fast and the light is just awesome and the treat must have been great cause Scarlett Grace ate her fast and really wanted more .
I will order stuff for Scarlett Grace and me again for sure !!
You should go online and check out all the things for cats too .
Awesome Pawsome stuff !
They listed parts with the wrong application on their website and now I'm stuck having to deal with their error .
I had slow shipping , wrong parts , and now will have to pay for it to be shipped back and restocking .
It doesn't take a geek to realize they sucker their buyers .
This will be my last purchase with them unless they make this right , which based on what I'm seen so far means they won't.
B&H Is The Best !!!
B&H is my favorite web site to buy all things tech .
Their web site and pricing is the best .
WHen I find cheaper prices , they are usually scam web sites that either do not deliver or jack up the shipping cost after wasting your time .
Save time and aggravation and order from B&H .
Their prices and delivery are near impossible to beat .
Great , reliable and friendly service .
I went to Global to park my car for a business trip .
They were fast , friendly and very accommodating .
They also offer car cleaning .
When I returned , I was brought back to my car and they even helped me pack my luggage in the trunk .
Unlike those other services that drop you off and leave you to your own , they made sure I was returned to my car safely .
I would recommend this place to anyone that needs to park their car prior to any trip .
Very easy , helpful telephone advice , lenses arrived fast too ...
Great service , cheapest good brand lenses , good telephone support , lenses arrived fast ...
exactly what I ordered and super fast shipping !
Best online store , best quality and top fashion
Yes Style has always provided me with the best and updated fashions .
From each season there are always sales and plenty of sizes and colors to choose from .
Only online shop that is super quality .
Excellent overall ; would use again
Best price on the web .
Actually found the same price at CarRentals . com but RentalCars . com gives a 5% rebate through Mr .
Rebates and the other company is only 3% .
Very easy to use .
The nice lady at Enterprise gave us a free upgrade from the Ford Focus(Economy ) to a brand new Chrysler 200(Midsize) .
The complimentary bottled waters was very nice too .
Total cost for one week in Jacksonville was $ 129.80 .
We were also able to add my wife as a driver for no additional charge .
The only issue was the gas .
I have always returned rental cars full in the past , but the price they offered was less , so I figured why not .
I wondered if there was a catch as the price was 15 cents a gallon less than on the street , but the lady said there were no other charges .
Well , it turned out the lady did not fully explain it and when we dropped off they were going to charge for a full tank while there was more than a quarter tank left .
I spoke to another nice lady in the rental office and she adjusted it to accurately reflect the fuel remaining .
Excellent overall and I will definitely us both RentalCars . com and Enterprise again in the future .
Very quick delivery and great quality item .
gewoon goed !
Goed product voor een goede prijs !
gewoon goed !
goed , goedkoop en snel !
Not worth the price
The liquids are okay , but for that price i can buy better liquids for a better price !
suprised and more than pleased with the service provided
we were really impressed with the service you provided .
we were not sure if we could get the part .
thanks to you it was ordered one afternoon , and delivered the next day .
we would have not hesitation in recommending you to our friends .
so well done for being so efficient .
no hassle shopping experience
ordering was easy delivery was prompt the product was good quality ill use them again in the future
I like your service but would find more help if mobile worked better
I have many issues signing into the website through my mobile phone .
I click on alerts and nothing happens .
I need to open the whole list of messages before the link works .
I'm not around my PC that much so my mobile phone is my PC .
i'm lovin it !!!
Nice program to make your album and the quality is really good !
i'm busy makin a new album !
The best antivirus program i've ever used , and i tried the best in the market .
It has protected my computer from all kinds of viruses including Trojans .
Accurate , fast and friendly service , no wasted motions .
We purchased a used motorhome and as a result there are things that require attention and this will be our choice to go to to solve problems .
I got what I needed right away !
Excellent Customer service !
They even let me choose the unit the met my needs the most .
Timely great quality parts at even better prices
The process was excatly the way you would expect it to be .
I enter my vehicle information , found the part that I needed , ordered and they were at my doorstep in a few days .
The parts fit and they were priced lower than anywhere else I looked on the net .
Parts Geek got it right the first time and that is something anyone can appreciate .
They will be the first place I look for auto parts from now on .
Amazing company , highly recommended !
Every time I purchase from Heinnie the service is amazing , the price is competitive and the speed of delivery is outstanding .
On the single occassion I had a problem with an item , the problem was dealt with promptly and professionally .
I would recommend Heinnie to everyone and frquently do .

The price was right and the delivery was timely . Best of all it worked !
Super fast delivery , Great cheap prices !
I needed contact lenses for the Glastonbury festival next week , but didn't want to be ripped with regards to the price , that 's where Lenstore came in , fabulous competitive prices , extremely fast delivery !
They totally dropped the ball and I will never order from them again .
I ordered dog food with two day free delivery .
After 5 days it still had not shown up .
I had gotten no correspondence from the company other than the initial confirmation of my order .
So , I called .
They told me there had been a recall on one of the products .
But they had never bothered to contact me to tell me that so , had I not called , I wouldn't have known .
But , then he told me that he was fixing the issue and was shipping my order out and that it would be delivered in the next few days .
A few days later , only half the order showed up .
The recalled item was never shipped .
So I called back .
This time I was told again that there had been a recall and that replacement food was still not in stock .
Once again , I was never notified of that .
When I had called the first time , I was told it was in stock and that the whole order would ship .
This time I was told something different .
Then he proceeded to tell me that it would be another week before I would see it delivered .
So , free two day shipping turned into a two week wait with very poor communication and answers I only received because I had to call them twice to get the information .
They offered no refund for the inconvenience or any other offer .
Meanwhile my dog had to eat oatmeal for a week because she had no food .
Ridiculous , crappy service and I will never ever order from them again .
The Geeks do bad business .
I received the wrong part and in order to return it I have to hurdle through their website and possibly pay restocking fees regardless who 's fault it was , they titled the merchandise correctly they obviously don't stock their merchandise correctly .
Unable to get through by phone after on hold for 20 plus minutes .
That 's not right , I will never do business with this website again .
Cheap parts as described , fast shipping
Parts arrived quickly ; I haven't installed them yet , but they appear to be what I ordered .
Super Service !
Orderd my appliance , from the nice and easy website !
Had quick reply with all details by E-mail and excellent text communication for the delivery !
All round a cracking service
An amazing service and a superb tumble dryer .
When my last tumble dryer developed a fatal fault I asked the repairman to recommend the best place to get a new one .
He recommended ... Appliances Online , " I get all my electricals from them ".
He preferred Appliances Online he said as even though he received an employee discount Appliances Online still worked out cheaper .
After researching different tumble dryers with as much care as I i did my last holiday , I made the big step and rang to order .
The lady at the call centre couldn't have been nicer or more helpful .
Two days later I received a call saying my machine would be delivered around 8.30 am .
that morning .
Guess what ... at exactly 8.30 am the door bell rang and two very cheerful deliverymen brought my machine in with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of courtesy .
My tumble dryer operates exactly as described in the appliance video .
Incidentally as someone disabled those videos were great as I could quickly rule out machines where , in the video , the door seemed stiff to open etc .
In conclusion my choice of machine wasn't the cheapest but experience has shown me that you generally get what you pay for .
Saying that it certainly wasn't in the most expensive range .
Using it is a dream ; a large porthole , an operating dial that turns easily and a clear " time remaining " display .
Cleaning out lint after use is easy too .
The only downside for me is emptying the water tank but hey ho that is what family are for .
I love Photobooks ... they are a fantastic way of displaying and cataloguing your prints and I have always used Jessops .
However I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the colour in my most recent book .... the photographs have been printed quite dark and they were not like this on the preview .
When the cost of purchasing these books is quite high , I expect it to be right .
Let down !
that 's always great feelling to shop at partsgeek . thanks
Very disappointed with the experience
Firstly , my bags were arranged and paid for to be collected at the given address from the UK mainland on Thursday 16th May between 9am and 6pm .
I made sure that I was available during this time to ensure the bags were collected , but it came to 17:45 pm and still nobody have showed up to collect my bags .
I then rang parcel force as Uni Baggage I had no answer , the women I spoke to told me that the bags should have been picked up and had no idea why they weren't.
It was then arranged for the bags to be collected on the following day , Friday 17th between 12pm and 3pm as I had to leave the address at 4pm in order to get a train to the airport , as well as being told my bags would be upgraded to 24hrs to ensure I still received my bags at the destination on the Monday 20th as agreed .
It was then brought to my attention that my bags were already paid for express 48 which is the only option available .
As you can imagine , this was extremely annoying as I had changed and cancelled plans to ensure that I was at the address .
On Friday , I waited and waited for someone to show and yet again it came to 14:45 pm and still I had my bags .
I then rang parcel force who told me I needed to speak to the stoke-on-Trent depo .
Once I got in touch with them , I then spoke to another women who tracked my order to tell me someone had been to the address in the morning time , which was not what was agreed , to find that instead of ringing the contact number given to them so as I could let them in through the security gates , they just drove off .
I found this woman very helpful and she took the time to ring round drivers to see who was available to collect my bags .
Eventfully my bags were collected at 15:40 pm .
In all I am still very disappointed with the service provided , as I have used Uni Baggage twice before and both times I have had no trouble .
It also concerns me that a driver may have arrived on Thursday as agreed and without thinking to contact me to open the gates just drove off .
There are a number of issues i think needs to be addressed with the Uni Baggage service to ensure that this does not happen again .
One issue is the communication between drivers collecting said parcels needs to be addressed as the matter could have been avoided with a simple phone call .
I also think that giving time slots to customers paying and using the Uni Baggage service would be more beneficial as saying between 9am and 6pm is very vague and it means customers can plan there day around the pick-up as opposed to waiting around all day for someone to show or in my case , not show .
Good prices , fast shipping .
I will definitely order from West Coast Shaving again .
OUTSTANDING Customer service !!!
I had purchased a 3 year protection plan for my GPS a little over 2 years ago .
I had a little skepticism as I never really trusted warranty companys .
But Square Trade had a pretty good recommendation from a friend so I decided to give them a shot .
I'm glad I did .
SquareTrade has totally and completely changed my attitude .
About a week ago my GPS had fallen off the windshield and hit the ground .
It cracked my screen and made it unusable .
I looked at my warranty and it said it was good for accidental damage .
I logged on to Square Trade and filed a claim .
Within an hour I received an email with a Fedex label and instructions to send them my GPS .
It also stated that I was eligible for a refund of my original purchase price .
I packed up my GPS and dropped it off at Fedex .
By 5:00 pm that afternoon I received another email with my choice of refund .
Which in my case was an Amazon gift card .
Thanks to Square Trade 's EXCELLENT service I was able to order a new GPS to replace the broken one all within the same day .
Based on my experiences I would HIGHLY recommend Square Trade to anyone looking to extend the warranty on any device they purchase !
Great service !
Good communication and a very quick delivery thanks
Fast shipment and great price .
Arrived about three days after order processed and work wonderfully .
I saved a lot of money ordering from partsgeek .
Thank you !
Great Value and service
They had what I needed at the best price I could find and the service before and during fitting was very good .
partsgeek saved my car from going to the junkyard .
I appreciate the extensive inventory of partgeeks .
The online site is easy to maneuver as well as navigate .
The products are price below most auto stores .
i received a leakage bottle
The price of the bottle was GBP 350 ; Grand Total ( with insurance , delivery ... ) GBP 450 .
The bottle was leakage .
Only Reaction of WhOnl .
" we check all bottles " or " will fail while in transit " or " We do state this in our terms and conditions ".
I payed GBP 24 , - for insurance - no reaction .
Result : i get a damaged bottle - i bear the risk - WhOnl .
only makes the profit .
According to german law this would not be possible .
Transcription was accurate and quick !
Very quick turnaround , no problems found in text .
Good job !
Excellent product , fair prices , fast shipping ,
See above , plus I will buy again .
A place I feel that I can trust .
I usually order optics and electronics from B&H over all the other online vendors because their prices are always competitive , their web site is very informative , they have an outstanding inventory and they have never disappointed me .
I know that I can trust them to deliver and they stand behind what they sell .
I don't know what else I could ask of any vendor , so I will continue to do business with this fine company .
Responsive company who do what they say
When I emailed about the RAM costing more than at a rival company , I got a speedy reply explaining that I was looking at the wrong figures .
I purchased the RAM which arrived in good time .
Now fitted and all is as it should be , so far .
You exceeded my expectations !
It has taken over a year for my rescue cat , Macy , to decide what she is willing to eat so I am new at ordering pet products online .
I checked out several sites and started filling my cart from one of them .
But when I tried to find 3 oz .
cans of PetGuard cat food , they did not carry that size .
I needed the other things so I placed that order .
Then I went to your site and found the exact canned foods I was looking for .
I ordered the canned food from you .
Thank you for carrying the smaller size cans and next time I order products , I will turn to Mr . Chewy FIRST .
Your service is excellent .
Great prices , good products .
I purchased a wheel sensor and Parts Geek had the best price .
I was very satisfied with the product .
It had all the ties and grommets that were on the factory sensor I replaced .
I will not hesitate to use Parts Geek again for my next auto part need .
quick and reasonable !
Got my order in nine days and the postal service even sent it to wrong town .
Got free stuff too and only spent like $22 with shipping awesome .
will summit another order .
Great service and delivery
My order was received really quickly although there was a delay when I exchanged due to a poor fit .
I would use them again .
Easy to use website and fast delivery every time
I've purchased goods from Wood Finishes Direct several times and never had a problem .

Great service !
Excellent service and goods
Great website and easy to use .
Excellent products and very fast delivery .
It was very easy , but I booked the wrong date and immediately called and wasn't able to get a refund .
My error , but within 5 minutes I should get my money vack
It 's easy to book , just be very careful about the date
Easy fit shocks with performance
The Shocks proved easy to fit with attached crown race .
The Shocks have proved easy to adjust and feel responsive .
I like Auto Europe ...
The only issue , when booking I end up confused as to what coverage I really need , and end up paying more at the rental location at time of booking than I should have .
Even with as much research I did and communicate with my Credit Card ( I have an expensive frequent airline one which gives additional coverage when traveling overseas) , I still end up taking on too much when the rental company clerk says if I get into a collision , I will have to pay a $ 2,000 deductible ... so I take the additioanl coverage ( which are written in different ways with different terminologies) .
Otherwise I good experience in general
My main source of games
User friendly , excellent delivery service , but app needs more work
Awesome school bag !
Bought this bag for my son to use as a school bag .
He told me that it 's been great and fits all of his books , folders and even his food tech ingredients in it !
As he walks to and from school , it is comfortable to wear across the body .
I'm working on other places to put codes in keyless entry
still on the fence I went to dealership to have keys coded they told me they charge 90 . for one hour of labor , I'm checking around or I will have to return them that insane .

Needed quick birthday present .
Game arrived the next day as promised at a great price .
Excellent value - good products
I'm very pleased with the new curtain - good quality , good value , well made .
I shall certainly order further net curtains as and when required .
The only glitch was a delay in delivery - not your fault - it took Royal Mail 3 days to deliver your packet by 1st class ' recorded delivery'.
Excellent service and quality
Have now used Jessops for three years to prepare an annual photo album from the preceding year and despite the business hiccup in January 2013 I have been extremely pleased with the product and the service .
I recommend it quite frequently .
Good service delivered
Our rower was delivered within 2 days of our on-line order , placed at a weekend .
The product description was accurate and we are very pleased with the purchase .
found a inexpensive part that saved the customer a lot of money over the dealer part .
FIt and function was good
A reliable service
The process is very easy and ive never had a problem selling a phone to envirophone and even tho my phone was late due to a delayed upgrade they upheld the price they had quoted me even tho the phone i had , had dropped value on their site . my only negative so to speak , is that I wished I had got a bit more for my phone but it was ' nt a bad price I got .
First time is the charm , my cats are doing the happy dance
I discovered Chewy . com after becoming concerned about feeding my beloved kitties a common , named brand cat food instead of the high quality , more natural food that they deserve .
After doing some online searching and finding chewy.com , I made some decisions and ordered two cases of Nature 's Variety " Instinct " in duck and rabbit .
I also ordered some Evo Wild Cravings treats and several other healthy snacks .
I'm lucky because our cats are not finicky but they have taken to this food like gang busters .
The extra cost is well worth it and the free shipping on larger orders was the final drawing card .
My ordered arrived a day ahead of what I expected too .
These people got the job done for me in a fast and efficent way .......
I've been looking for a good credit adviser and until I met these folks .... Ron went to great lengths to get the job done and at an affordable rates so I could keep my profits in MY business .... too bad there aren't many GOOD people out there like them but when you have a chance to work with them ... you won't go anywhere else . Thanks Again for your services .
Excellent products and stock .
The website is really easy to use and I always find what I am looking for .
Their stock is great and item descriptions are very helpful .
It 's a one stop shop for a photographer .
These replacement heads for my Braun toothbrush are very good quality .
Had them for a couple of weeks and they are working really well .
Wonderful book buyer !
I love sites that make it easy to work with them !
Wonderful and glorious site to conduct business with and to release some of my " no longer needed " books to !!!
Quality parts and fast delivery !
My friends told me they get all of their parts from here so I did .
I'm so satisfied with my order .
Will order again from here !
Trustworthy , timely , and great service !
I needed to ship my car from Chicago to southern California .
When I first called Montway , I had done a lot of research online .
Most car shipping companies are not recognized by the BBB , but Montway has got a A rating .
To me , this was very important because I have read a LOT of horror stories online .
I was very nervous about having my car shipped , and one of the team members , Bobby , was very patient and helpful in answering the abundance of questions I had for him .
Also , every time I called , the staff seemed very caring , available and willing to answer all questions .
The best part was , my initial phone call was to get a quote , and thereafter I did not receive phone calls or emails soliciting my business , which was great .
I called back when I was ready to book a pick up .
Again , I found out about Montway on my own after several weeks of research .
Most other companies incessantly call or email you for your business , and in my opinion , this is a BAD sign .
Although not the cheapest company out there , Montway DID offer a price match for another company quote I received that was of equal quality rating .
( nice !
My vehicle was contracted out to a third party contractor , Ebs Transport , and my driver , Bagi , was great !
He came when he said he was going to , and dropped my car off right in front of my home in California when he said he was going to .
My car was in great shape with no damage .
I had great communication with the driver and all parties responsible the whole time , which is something I was very concerned about .
I have already recommended Montway to a friend who is planning to ship her car from texas to washington DC .
I am positive she will also have a great experience .
Great on site management , clean and secure .
Renting was easy .
Great location and nice facilities .
People who run the office super friendly and helpful .
I was impressed .
Great , fast delivery
Thank you we got the labels fast and on time .
Great Customer Service
I've purchased many tires from Town Fair Tire .
This last purchase was made even better due to the customer service and help from Louie in Branford .
A cooling breeze
Part arrived very quickly .
Came more complete than I thought it would be .
Installed in 5 mins and running .
Brilliant service , ordered and delivered within the week .
delivery guy was here just after 6.30 am !
! Really pleased with the pool table , will make Christmas for the lads .
EXCELLENT - Great customer service , great product !
I recently ordered new USB flash drives from Flashbay and Dave Patterson , the Account Manager , assisted me .
It was an absolute pleasure working with Dave .
His customer service skills are outstanding and the order was done even earlier than expected - thank you so much again !
The Flash drives look awesome and we are very satisfied !
Thank you very much !
So good news , like everyone else everything went pretty smoothly .
Got what I ordered within a reasonable time frame , and the silver seems good .
I plan on using them again in the future .
very easy to find what I needed
Parts were very easy to find for the vehicle .
Will definitely use this site again for future repairs .
Prices were reasonable and shipping didn't take long
love you guys .
when it comes to parts , i go to the geek first !
Partsgeek has done well by me but now I'll be checking out their return policy .
I did not need the part I ordered so we'll see how the refund goes .
thx partsgeek !
Loved the shoes
The shoes were dispatched and arrived promptly , really pleased with them and with the service .
Would definitely use again
Fast and reliable
I am a complete sewing machine novice but this is exactly as described and ideal for a beginner like me .
Great company to deal with
Prompt and efficient service
Goods matched the descriptions and were promptly dispatched .
I received the order for a driver 's side rear view mirror for a 2009 Toyota Yaris .
The order was received with a " manual " mirror vice " automatic " mirror .
The order process did not allow for the choice .
The order was sent ( per the packaging label ) to 10810 Boyette Road , Riverview , FL 33569 .
However , the address I am at which is the address ordered for is 12108 Timberlake Road , Riverview , FL 33569 .
The order was received without the cable from the mirror to the car .
A totally unacceptable experience .
Fast service !
Received my items within 2 working days after placing order .
LOOOVED IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I let my daughters pick a few things online for christmas that they wanted and the found 10 dollar mall .
we found alot of nice things at a good price and received our order within a week .
we are all very happy .
So easy to use the site
This is the only place I buy camera and editing equipment from !
Has some of the best deals and prices I can find .
Teva makes the best most comfortable flip flops hands down !
I will buy none other .
Love how I can look up and find just about anything !
Can keep a person occupied all day long .
Live this site , makes Transactions safe and secure and worry free .
my favorite site
Everything has shipped very fast .
Easy to track shipments , competitive prices , good variety of inventory .
awesome service !
I love this service , having to make a trip into town to buy dog food , when I am out , is now one less thing I have to worry about for my beautiful Jack Russells .
Such a convenience for me since I live an hour out of town .
Good products room for improvement with delivery service
Very pleased but it would be nice to have an option on upgrading to a competant courier .
On balance you get what you pay for with theses cheap delivery companies so no big issues , but I woukd have happily paid for a £5 premium to use Royal Mail or Parcelforce delivery .
Great Value and Great Customer Care ( rare these days )
I am a repeat customer having only bought a few items , but from what I have seen so far i will be repeat customer again and again .
I over ordered recently and Tredz were very understanding and cancelled part of my order with no fuss or question .
Vale and customer care are rarely seen these days but I think Tredz understands the market place much better than their competitors .
Well done to all at Tredz .
Good sound technical advice and great value for money
I sent Wiggle a technical question about suitability of a replacement bottom bracket set and advice on size differentials .
The question was answered very professionally and in good time .
It was for this reason I decided to become a Wiggle customer .
I didn't even buy the b/b from Wiggle , but just the fact they were able to offer the technical help with no strings attached is praise worthy as far as I am concerned .
I will definitely use Wiggle in the future for my cycling purchases .
Speed of the online service was very good and tracking of consignment also a big plus .
Well done to you all keep up the good work .
I'd hope to be able to say something about the items themselves ...
But I've not received my package as of yet .. Est delivery was to be 11/18/13 and still nothing ...
The date now is 11/20/13 ...
Great partner !
Nothing to add .
Great quality clothing !
Great quality stylish clothing at reasonable prices .
Very flattering cut .
Would definitely recommend !
How easy can it be ... Skypark Easy - will def be using again !
drove up , the system recognised my car details and printed the ticket with registration on ... parked my car and off i went !
The following day my car is secure and easy to find , put ticket in barrier and drove away - no finding change or queing for machines .... just out and away !
Excellent Service and Repair Support
My 7 year daughter cracked her Chrome notebook screen and I was about to buy a new notebook when I found Laptopscreen’s website .
Not only did this company save me $200+ dollars but with the “how to” video I was able to complete the repair in about 30 minutes !
All in all , a fast , responsive and supportive tech company – can’t ask for much more than that !!
Good experience .
Hotel 's direct site didn't allow you to book stays of less than 3 nights .
Was able to get a one night stay at traveloicity , with a good selection of rooms to choose from .
the dress didn't fit .
I tried to return it but turns out it was too late .
there should be a longer return deadline .
My first time , great service , I will be back !
Website not uptodate with the availability
Just a gimmick to bring people to buy but most of the models are not available .
They gave an option for 15% discount which I have not received it yet .
When you call on their toll free , rarely someone picks up .
Overall will not recommend anyone to buy from SBG
love SpareFoot ..
I was able to find the best deal ever .
I got the best deal and its locked in for my entire lease , also i did no running around to find the best price .
I simply went to SpareFoots website put in my zip and boom there was the best offers right in my view .
Highest service , lowest price
I have been using Hotel club for several years and have always found good hotels at great prices .
I stay at 2 particular hotels in London , Days Hotel Hounslow and Jury 's Inn , Hatton Court , and in Hong Kong always the BP International House .
I have used HC over 70 times in the past 4 years or so from Santa Monica to Beijing , and London to Johannesburg .
I have never been disappointed and the reward dollars are a great bonus
First class service
Forget about buying your appliaces from anywhere else ao.com have provided me with a service and price that no one else could match ... Thank you
Excellent end product , difficult to navigate
It is sometimes difficult to use the software but the end product is excellent
Good experience-will definitely recommend
The overall experience was good .
Appropriately priced . Quick delivery .
Happy with the service .
Good service , very smooth , as expected .
The service was as advertised and all went very well .
One very slight gripe is that a muddy mark was left on the drivers door sill .
Why do it any other way !
Excellent easy to use website , competitively priced , convenient , what more is there to say !
Fast delivery , quality product
Specs arrived very promptly and as described .
Very happy with the service and quality of the specs .
I ordered a pair of shoes for me size 7 and a pair for my sis size 9 .
I loved them .
The quality could have been a little better but for $ 12.99 , I am actually surprised they've lasted me as long as they have .
They were comfortable and cute .
I had also ordered them last minute and I received them withing 1 week .
Great styling options for great prices !
YesStyle provies users with an array of fashion options from multiple companies and countries .
Their service only gets better with time and the only issue I have with them is it can take a couple weeks to get a shipment but that 's what happens when you're shipping across oceans and countries .
I have come to realise that Doheny is simply the best selection , best price & RELIABLE
As an experienced pool owner , I have shopped at many " retailers " that offered unique products and a reasonable selection .
However , I have had to travel many miles to many different locations .
With Doheny I receive timely catalogs with featured specials and fast free shipping !
When I found myself shopping for a complete filter/pump solution before the start of this years swimming season , I researched many " retailers " and on-line companies but none came close to Doheny .
How many companies can deliver a complete filter/pump and additional accessories the next day at the lowest price ?
Not many , and most importantly , I have now come to trust Doheny for ALL my pool needs , whether it is a complete filter/pump solution , new hoses or even my pool opening & closing kits .
Thanks Doheny , I appreciate your level of customer service !
I accidentally found UKHairdressers . com by accident whilst searching for a product to help keep my red hair vibrant in between salon visits .
Now that I have I'll never look back !
They have the best range of products from the best brands all in one place .
They also offer the best prices and are a far far cheaper alternative to buying your products direct from the salon ( thank god !
And then to top it all off , the postage is free ( wow !!
) and my product arrived practically the next day - what excellent service .
Would highly recommend this website to all of my friends and family .
I am very happy doing busuness with Petfow
I love petflow ..
I love the scheduled delivery of my fav dog food for my rottweiler .
It is one less worry on my mind to remember to buy dog food .
With the weather central Pennaslvania has been having , it 's wonderful to not have to get out and drive to the store .
The prices at petflow are exactly what I would pay if I went to Petco and it 's deliverd to my door...can't beat that .
If there is a problem with a delivery , Petflow has taken care of the problem to my satisfaction .
I tell all my dog owner friends about Petflow .
Keep up the wonderful job .
Great Service Great Product
I have placed two orders and have been very pleased with both .
the orders arrived quickly and exceeded my expectations .
I bought a sheet set and a blnket for my son who suffers from allergies and eczema .
He loves them .
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE GOCOFFEEGO !!!!
I have been in touch several times with customer service questions and they responded as if I was their best friend in the world !
I never worry about having to ask a question .
As for purchasing from GoCoffeeGo , they are my absolute go-to place to buy coffee .
I like the variety of choices , terrific customer service , always great humor - even on the website , and quick delivery .
And THANKS FOR THE SPECIALS WITH FREE DELIVERY !
I'm just still waiting for Batdorf and Bronson to come back .
As I said , I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE GoCoffeeGo !!
Great in a tight spot !
I ran into an unexpected situation with my move and was in desperate need of a small storage facility for a few weeks until I could sort it out .
With SpareFoot I was able to find a storage space small enough that I wasn't going to be paying for space I didn't need .
I was also able to reserve my locker without paying anything up front or having to give my payment info to hold the spot !
They will even let someone else check in to your storage space for you , which means my friend could go and get access to my storage for me while I am running around like crazy trying to get everything else done .
And , if all of this wasn't enough , they are affordable , do not require a lease , and even offered a $20 rebate after move in !
Awesome service !
Customer Feedback !
Have purchased from Parts-geek a couple of times .
Was very satisfied with each service and the high quality parts .
Parts are moderately priced compared to other competitors in the business .
My suggestion is for them to enlist PAYPAL as an additional method of payment .
Just not comfortable with having to input your entire credit card information each time you purchase from Part-Geek website
First time buyer on supplement warehouse and was impressed with the prices !
the ink cartridge leaks upon opening stained my chair
Easy to use ,
Easy to use , great products at a good price and they don't charge too much for shipping .
Very good , prompt and helpfull .
New exactly what was requierd and dispached prompley .
Consistent , excellent service
I have been using Cult Pens as my main supplier for the past 3.5 years .
Their shop offers a vast variety of goods to choose from , and site 's user-interface has been user-friendly .
Not once has Cult Pens failed or disappointed me .
There has been pens that disappointed me , but Cult Pens were happy with deal with my returns as well .
The staff were highly helpful in answering my questions over the years .
I am extremely impressed with Cult Pens .
Thank you .
Clarity and great options .
its helpful and cheap .
granted it is not a mom and pop , they are useful when one is not around you .
Could be easier
While the price is attractive , it could be smoother if the hotel front desk was given a copy of the confirmation .
I had difficulty pulling up the email confirmation in their lobby .
Thankfully the front desk clerk was accommodating and we made the shuttle with a few minutes to spare .
Just some stress that we didn't need before a flight .
Initial shipment was fast .
My filters were damaged in transit by the delivery company .
I received new filters free of charge with a couple days .
Great to see a company that stands by the entire shipment process .

Talk about Fast delivery !
I placed the order for my toner at 1am in the morning and it was delivered the same day .
If you need an office supply immediately I recommend HotToner
great place to buy from
low shipping cost makes this place competive with local parts stores and is easer to have them shipped then to go pick them up a local store .
The first bag didn't do any good but thought I would give it a chance and try again , the second bag nothing .
Great product .
Quick Shipment !
This was my first purchase from Fireside Chimney Supply and I will definitely use them again if I need their products .
Best discount tee times !
I use golf 18 very often .
Not only do I use it for my local course in Ohio , but I also use it to try different courses in the area .
I work in retail and I recommend golf 18 to all my golfing customers .
Golf 18 network hands down is the best in discount tee times !!
Keep up the great work !
Service was everything I expected
I loved the ease of ordering , the ability to track the package and the ease of payment .
Very pleased with service
Once again ... ProWorld Rocks !
This is my 3rd time ordering from ProWorld .

I ordered rhinestone transfers this time , and a few of the stones did come loose , but it 's nothing a tweezer can't fix ... will order again .... and again !
Thanks ProWorld !

Found parts for our Mercedes that would have cost 10 times as much through a dealer !
Listen , I searched everywhere for axels for our 2003 Mercedes because the local Mercedes dealership said it was going to cost a bazillion bucks to do the job .
I just knew in my bones I could do better on the parts ( you know how most shops double the price of the parts at least) .
So , I called salvage yards for used parts , regular parts stores who say they cannot get mercedes parts , and dealerships as many said " you have to go to a dealer for those parts ".
Of course , the dealers were the most expensive .
Then I found " The Parts Geek ".
They saved me a ton of money and the parts arrived sooner than predicted .
A solid 10 !
Well , a 5 star rating .
Dependable and perfect condition .
Thank you .
Not a good job guys
I bought two parts for two different cars first one arrived in a timely manner .
2nd part was shipped late arrived late and was incorrect .
It took me three days to get the approval to return the wrong part back and had to pay $15 to return it .
At best you can rank your selves D in customer service .
Easy and quick service
If you would like to send flowers on occasion to U.K. this is 5 minute solution .
No need for time consuming sing ins .
I highly recommend .
i'm happy with the treatment .
i recommend it
Lots of quality products at good prices .
Best choice for travellers
Hostelworld . com is just the best possibility to find hostels in every town .
We're travelling for a few months now and hostelworld never disappointed .
You can see what other people think of the hostels , what you have to spend for the night and make reservations .
Just great !
the item described not the same in delivery , flowers to small not deluxe , 1 item missing .
I ordered 25 deluxe roses , the roses were too small , teddy bear missing , so for a special occasion a bad expirence .
Great Options at Great Prices
i've been using supplement warehouse now for several years and i have to say you can't beat the prices , even with the shipping included .
there are more options for brands , supplements , and serving sizes than i've ever seen .
love using this site , very trustworthy and when product ships it has always reached me within 3 days !
love the site , use it !
Good Prices , Poor Customer Service
They have potential to be a great distributor , but lack of customer service is a big problem .
You can't call and talk to a person you have to submit a support ticket and communicate via e-mail , which take 24 hours to receive a response .
My order was half out of stock and I was suppose to be refunded in 3-4 business days and here we are on the 6th and still , no refund .
They have great potential if they would just improve on customer service and claims .
They are the best online .
I love this place online .
I hate going to their store in the city .
For instance , the salesman will sell you a $1600 Metz flash for your Hasselblad then tell you quite persistently that their battery prices are cheaper than Duane-Reade across the street .
I think it 's a sport for the sales staff to get in a successful lie with each sale .
The whole scene is low class with all those turnstiles and BO but , hey , they win because they invest in inventory .
Compare to Calumet 's biz model .
B&H looks real good next to those dummies .
the always amazing bookit . com
i'm queen of the vacation deals .
and bookit is my number one source .
id love to keep the secret to myself , convince my husband 's family that " we've just got it like that ".
but truth be told , bookit is my secret weapon .
Excellent price , service & delivery .
I am a very happy shopper .
First class service through out the purchases .
excellent service , very good response-
I'm telling to my Friends about your service , is my first experience with your company and I see thats very good .
thank you very much .
Perfect transaction .
Quick mailing .
Item was delivered within days .
Item was just what I wanted but they have a great refund policy just in case .
lovely cottages Home from Home
We have been renting the same cottages for New Year for the past 8 years , need I say more
great shopping experience " it did what it said on the tin "
Loved the fact that I received an e Mail on the delivery morning telling me my delivery time down to 1 hour and even the drivers name in my case George
Order on the Friday morning was delivered Saturday morning excellent service : 0 )
Great delivery product everything cheers
Last two deliveries have been poor .
One order was incorrect the other took ages despite paying for next day delivery , I was given a 10% off my next order but still not great service .
Sorry folks but Will probably look elsewhere next time
It 's easy to order on YesStyle .
There are also awesome and beautiful products at great prices !!
Fast shipping , great service ...
The website is very easy to use .
Well I just love this site so much !!!
Thank you !!!!
Great prices and great selections

I will always check thier site first for quality and resonable prices .
Couple travel insurance to family travel insurance
Anytime I have compared travel insurance Multitrip always come out on top .
The reason been for better value and covering all relative travel needs that could happen while travelling .
Options of extra travel needs are also available to add on or take off travel insurance policy before purchase .
Easy to use website displaying reasonably priced goods , and prompt delivery in a secured box , clearly marked fragile .
I found the product I wanted at a good price delivered within a few days .
Fantastic service and price !
I was very pleased with my purchase from PureFormulas .
The product was exactly what I ordered and it was shipped exactly in the time frame stated .
I will definitely refer my friends and family .
I will order again ..
First time but will NOT be my last !
This was our first time using priceline .
This site made searching for and reserving a hotel so much simpler , and at a VERY good price !
fast and reliable service
I had short time to get the item I asked for and I got it just in time .
exactly what I wanted
ordered two net curtains came within a week and are great
Never buy games anywhere else again .
Amazing service super fast , free next day delivery and you earn points when you buy towards money off next purchase .
I love it to be honest !
I feel secure when I'm buying if you spend to much ( and I do ) it asks you to confirm your credit card details .
You will also receive an email within about 2 minutes with a picture of your parcel on it 's way out
And I think pretty much everything is at a discount even new releases so I'm happy with that aswell , as I said never buying my games from anywhere else again .
your comtermer service is great
sales rep was very helpful kevin cleared up some problems for me .
the manufacture did not include the instructions with the ac unit .
he looked up what i needed so i could install theunit to get it to work , thanks vic caronna
as tina turner said simply the best
good price good service easy site to use fast delivery what more do you whant
top of the pops first class
top seller in all ways delivery and service top class
Good price , speedy turnaround
I went with Fonebank as I had used them before and even though they offered £10 less than a few other competitors , they had much better reviews and I already knew them to be reliable and trustworthy .
I was not let down .
I posted the phone in the manner instructed and within 2 days had the full amount estimated in my bank account .
Couldn't ask for a better service .
Will definitely use again and would recommend to anyone .
Disappointed wth service
I still have not received my order after nearly 2 weeks .
I tracked it online and went to the delivery company website where I found the company had ' attempted delivery twice ' - this was not the case as I was at home on both occasions they claim to have attempted delivery .
No card had been left to suggest I had missed a delivery so if I hadn't looked into this myself I would have had no idea where my items were .
I tried to arrange a redelivery which has still not shown up and I contacted customer services at Boohoo about this matter on Thursday 31st May and have still had no response from them ( Sunday 3rd June) .
Luckily I paid through paypal , which as well as being convenient means I can open a case to try and get my money back if the matter is still not resiolved next week .
Very disappointed .
I previously used Fedex to ship my clubs .
Your service is much better .
I will continue to use it and have also recommended it to my friends .
The cartridges are excellent
The first cartridges did not fit and when I called inkfarm , she sent me another set immediately and they are perfect .
She said I have to return those did not fit , but I have not received any return information , yet .
Excessive cost for the part I required
The part I required was a plastic plug connecting the outlet pipe to the shower hose on a 8.5 w NewTeam shower .
The design and routing was , in my estimation , such that undue strain was placed on the part causing the failure .
The part I estimate to cost only pence but as I was obliged to buy the outlet pipe as well the total cost was £ 12.01 including P&P .
The part merely pushed into the outlet pipe(which I discarded on receipt ) and was unnecessary .
Ordering and delivery was excellent .
Outstanding service and quality .
Parts came when they were due , The parts worked perfectly .
The price was right and the ease of ordering them was outstanding .
Why buy in a store when you can have it delivered to your door for free .
Great company , I will never go back to a brick and mortar store .
This company has made it so anyone can order online and have it delivered to your door .
Good value , mediocre shipping
Bookbyte has some great prices and a huge inventory , but with basic shipping , my book took quite awhile to arrive .
Fine Product , Meh Service
The product was fine .
Customer service was meh .
When I contacted them to update my order , they took the appropriate actions except for responding to my communication .
Nice products ; Easy to deal with
The store does not have absolutely everything under the sun that I need or want , but they do have quite a selection with something for everyone .
The prices are great and returns are never any issue for me .
However , I did receive a dress with a hole in it once and I was not pleased , though it got replaced quickly .
Typically , the shipping is fast ( at least in OH ) anyway .
my dog bone lights came .
very colorful .
Now Star & Gabe will be safe at night .
Straightforward no hassle from order to delivery .
Good price and good delivery .. will use site again . Thank-you .
i ordered a game of need for speed which apperently had run out of stock , within minutes i was given another game of same value of my choice , and a coupon with 8% off .

Happy Dogs !
Happy Owner !
I'm so pleased with the fast service I received after ordering a large bag of dog food on-line .
We were at the bottom of the bag when I ordered on a Fri . so thought I'd need to buy a small bag to get us through the weekend .
I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived home on Sat .
to find my order had been delivered that morning .
I'm on automatic delivery paying less than local pet stores charge and I'm happy about that .
All over in a Flush !
Ordered at 10.30 am , delivered the next day at half the price of the supplier I last bought the item from 8 years ago !
Fantastic experience !
Website clear and informative .
Ordering straightforward and delivery arrived when promised .
Simple order processed with the minimum of fuss !
Repeat customer over and over and over .
Supplement Warehouse is the first place I go to when I need to restock on supplements .
The things I love about them is the FREE stuff , the great pricing , the price match , and the ridiculously fast shipping .
It never fails , but when I order something , I usually don't expect to see it for a few days , but low and behold every time , it arrives a day or 2 faster than I expect .
I love companies that process orders correctly , and deliver on time , and Supplement Warehouse has delivered over and over again .
Thank you !
I've been using Comms Express for the last three years and in that period I've only had one wrong item delivered .
This was quickly rectified by a next day delivery .
Excellent customer service .
EXCELLENT SERVICE - WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND

Cool clothes , even cooler prices !
Great product range , latest trends , fast delivery , easy shopping experience .
Would recommend !
My order packed a left-handed punch !
Great service .
Quirky product .
Will definitely use again .
Fantastic Quick Good Quality service !
Really good price , for valet parking used the service last year at Terminal 2 , lets hope Terminal 1 is as good !
Car was there when we arrived home (~even better ) do not hesitate to book with Sky park meet & greet !
I hope it 's as good as the reviews say it is !
I'm still at home so I don't know if the site is reliable but I guess it is seeing as everyone has so many nice things to say about it .
Trademarkia was professional , kept us informed every step and delivered
If you need a trademark either nationally or internationally , Trademarkia makes the process easy to follow , and yet very thorough .
They are considerably less expensive than hiring a private attorney to accomplish the same ends and yet you feel like you have a team working for you .
UBS- Flashdrive . com came through for Us
We had less than a week to deliver 100 flashdrives to Scottsdale , AZ for a conference .
UBS- Flashdrive made it happen and delivered a day in advance with a quality product .
I would recommend them highly .

Second to none .
I am a professional photographer who has relied on B&H 's incomparable service and value for decades .
Their efficiency , knowledge , and sensitive customer care is incomparable .
An invaluable resource to professionals and enthusiasts alike .
The Joint Magazine gives the logo company 5 stars
after reasearching different companies to take on my logo design project , i chose the logo company .
the whole process went exactly like all the reviews i read .
the work was great , price was great , and they got in touch with me eveytime they said they would .
i got exactly what they advertised and it was a very simple process .
My logo came out great and we are all very happy with the job they did .
I would highly recommend Big Bus Tours .
We were able to see all the top sights and then spend extra time at the places that were of more interest to us .
We had the option of hopping on and off at our leisure .
Staff were helpful and very accommodating .
Thank you for a great day out !
Less than transparent and possibly deliberately opaque .
I questioned a few of the " Highland Titles " claims and swiftly received email responses that were well written , polite and skirted each of my concerns skillfully .
My questions centred around the notion of attaching the descriptor , " Laird " ( let alone Lord or Lady ) to the ' owner ' of one square foot of Scotland and to the conservation aspects of the " Highland Titles " business .
The emails flew thick and fast , each one polite and appearing to address my concerns until I sent a copy of an email I received from , " the Court of the Lord Lyon ".
( The Lord Lyon is quoted on the " Highland Titles " documents but , according to the Lord Lyon , out of context in such a way as to potentially mislead souvenir plot buyers .
) I have had no response from " Highland Titles " since .
The company 's interest in the conservation of the Highlands is not strengthened by the fact that their office is not IN Scotland but in the Channel Islands .
( a tax and to a degree , legal haven ) I have asked for but not received ANY information with regard to their conservation works other than photographs on their FaceBook page .
I read a letter on a website purportedly from a customer named , " Lady " something-or-other who claimed to have visited her plot and engaged in tree planting with other joyful " Lairds and Ladies ".
Sadly she said she had planted trees in " Glencoe " when in actuality her plot is supposed to be some miles away on Keil Hill .
When the letter was questioned on the website , no reply was forthcoming .
The company did however point out and very clearly that I could apply for a full refund after I receive my documentation , should I not be satisfied with their product .
I have rated the company with one star BUT I feel obliged to point out that whilst I am not satisfied with , " the product ", their representative [ Name removed ] was polite and reasonable to deal with at all times .
Because I have had some experience of statements quoted out of context in reference to this company , I will of course be keeping a copy of this review should it 's wording become muddled in some way , with all the emails I sent and received regarding this matter .
Should you like a copy of them email , [ Personal information removed ]
Great Service , Very reliable and always a saving from the retails stores
I have used Otticanet for many years now and never had a bad experience .
The communication regarding shipping and the tracking of your parcel is spot on and you are never left wondering when your goods will arrive .
Savings I make online allows me to buy 2 pairs of sunglasses for the same price of 1 pair in the retail store .
Awesome , responsive and accurate .
First time customer .
I will return in the future to keep my four cars running .
Ordered a pack of baby jackets as a gift for a friend .
They arrived earlier than expected and the quality was great
excellent value , quality and service
as usual my order was despatched immediately and all items were great quality
returns and refunds take too long
bought a onesie for my son in law for xmas , not colourfast and dyed his skin black .
returned for a refund but after 10 days still no word from boohoo , will not put me off shopping with them again but think returns and refunds should be improved on
Easier and clearer and cheaper than using the ferry company 's own web site !
We were trying to get a good price for a last minute day trip with cat , Dover-calais .
Spent ages trying to get the ' deals ' advertised by the ferry and tunnel companies , but the prices quoted were never those advertised .
In the end I tried AFerry , got a quick and clear quote , chose from a selectiion and all done and dusted .
Will use them again .
Good choice , good service and good price .
I need multi-focal toric lenses which are not easy to get hold of , and are very expensive from the opticians .
Lenstore have an amazing range of lens types to choose from , and were very competitively priced .
The ordering process in easy and repeat orders easier still .
It makes my life easier too .
The latest delivery even had sticky labels to put on the calender to remind me to re-order .
Not entirely necessary as they keep in touch by email - but welcome anyway .
Keep up the good work !
3 pills short of 90
I love Alpha brain and always look forward to getting my bottle of it !
But this time when I decided to order the 90count bottle , I decided to open it right when I got it and count them .
There were only 87 out of 90 there .
I recounted 4-5 times just to make sure I wasn't wrong but I wasn't.
The price they got for me was good , but their customer or service or lack thereof until after the fact was VERY disappointing and resulted in unneeded stress .
There 's no way to reach them by phone and when you shoot an e-mail it can take days to over a week to get a response .
In all fairness , they tried to help me once they finally responded which tells me they just don't have enough people onboard .
If they add more personell this could be a great service as they absolutely saved me money .
love the site easy to navagate thru
Great service and wide variety
I am very pleased with Chewy . com since I started my auto-ship for my 3 large dogs of dog food and treats .
I had previously been with another auto-ship vendor and the delivery was very slow and they were out of stock of the treats I wanted almost all the time .
The orders here go in on Friday and within just a few days the big boxes are on my doorstep .
The savings in shipping fees for me is astronomical too , the shipping I paid before was breaking my back .
Chewy has great markdown sales exclusive the auto-ship members as well as great sale prices in general .
I would not hesitate to recommend Chewy to anyone , anywhere with any kind of pet .
They meet your needs , while keeping the prices low .
I am very happy with my choice , the have low prices and a lot of size options so you aren't paying for space you don't need .
The security is good .
The business is simple , but that is really all you need .
I would , in fact , recommend it to anyone looking for storage options .
Wonderful service !
Lovely to work with Livia - she made us feel very comfortable !
Good selection and variety , simple and quick online shopping .
I bought a few things from the company a while back through YesAsia , but never really took the time to visit YesStyle when it opened .
The site does appear on many banner links and ads , so normally I become disinterested in it since things of those nature looks to be spam .
A few days ago , I saw a banner ad again , and just went ahead and checked out the site .
YesStyle has a large variety of choices for men to cater to different styles .
I was honestly only browsing , but ended up purchasing a good amount of items .
Website UI was easy to use , ordering process didn't take too long ( my complete purchase button did take a little while to finalize the order , although I didn't really notice since I was alt tabbed) .
I give YesStyle 5 stars since I could not think of anything bad about any processes dealing with this site .
I , of course , won't mind/probably will shop here again .

quality parts , great price
I got an alternator for less than half the price I could find locally .
It installed easily , no problems .
Shipping was weird , however .
The alternator was promptly shipped and went from San Bernardino to LA , to Dallas , to Ft . Worth , Oklahoma City , Enid , OK ( near my home ) and then it went to Corpus Christi , then back to Dallas , Enid , and finally to my home address .
Took nine days .
But I am happy with the alternator and the price .
Not half bad
I shopped around to find my idler pulley and was provided with a great list of possible parts .
I wasn't sure about the quality of some of the parts but I still got the perfect part at half price .
I loved the variety and having the exact part that I needed to replace made the job super simple .
I would shop this site again .
Very well planned and professional site ...
Manuevering the site was so very simple and easy , no one should have any trouble getting a booking done .
This is a well planned and professional type site .
Well done !
Very Professional and Prompt !
Received the parts promptly and have them installed already .
Price and shipping cost very decent , thank you for your promptness and professionalism .
amazing prices ... quick as a bunny !
They have everything I need for my 17 year old Mercedes ... All great dependable parts .
I would recommend to anyone !
Price efficiency speed E tyres is the one for me
Very pleasant tyre experience again .
E tyres came on time did the job on the drive , cleared away , perfect I recommend that next time you need you tyres changing give E tyres a chance to quote , you will not be disappointed .
Purchase dishwasher came 2 days later no problems
Outstanding Service , Outstanding Selection , Outstanding Prices !
Every time I order from B&H its a great experience !
They have it in stock , the prices are very reasonable , and they Do Not Overcharge for Shipping !
That 's why I always come back !

Good experience , but communication could be improved
We reserved a one-way car rental from Auto Europe US to be picked up in Sorrento , Italy in early May .
Luckily , we dropped by the EuropCar car agency in person the day before we were scheduled to pick up the car and were surprised to learn that the office would be closed the next day and that the Amalfi Coast route blocked for 8 hours for the Giro d'Italia bike race .
The EuropCar agent insisted that they had asked Auto Europe to inform us of this so it 's not clear where communication failed .
We were , however , able to pick up the car the day before , incurring an extra day charge which we paid directly to the rental agency .
They also helped us reroute around the road closure .
Drop of at the Palermo airport before the Europcar agency opened went without a problem but we still haven't received a final receipt as promised detailing the extra charges -- presumably for an airport drop-off .
Good Advice , Good Price , Good Service
I had used Blackcircles before so it was my first port of call when I needed two new front tyres for my Volvo XC90 .
The size I needed
offered four alternatives with varying prices which I found was a little
I rang Blackcircles to discuss my options and had very
sound and helpful advice without which I may well have bought two
unsuitable tyres .
I checked prices on similar sites and could find none to compete so placed my order and chose my fitting site and
All went fine and efficiently .
Very satisfied .
Excellent selection of writing and drawing nstruents
Quality products , good prices and immediate delivery .
Best by far
I have never had a problem with Very .
From the products to delivery .
Any issues I have had they have been resolved very quickly and very professionally .
If I had to have 1 negative it would be their premium line number but then again that could also be blamed on my telephone network provider .
Will always use Mazuma
Went online on the Sunday and printed of the documents .
Posted it , Special Delivery , on the Monday and we had the cheque on the Wednesday .
If that wasn't enough we got the full amount quoted , £ 265.00 , and was cleared on the Thursday .
Was more than impressed with the service .
quality of products and customer service second to none
Not only did I receive top quality customer service but to also have a product that works as it should was wonderful .
Would highly recommend Freeport Pro Cook and their products .
Fast delivery great glasses
I ordered a pair of Ralph Lauren glasses for £30 cheaper than the high street stores and delivery was quick too .
Packing was really good and the glasses came in a second box with Ralf Lauren embossed on it .
They also came with a free cleaning kit which is handy .
Glasses made in Italy
I would order another pair but my husband just about let me buy these !!
Loved the jacket , great quality and a good price .
Delivery was fast and trackable wouldn't hesitate to use them again or recommend them .
Value and variety
So far i've only bought meal vouchers which have all been great value .
The huge range of deals offered is better than the other voucher sites i subscribe to and if i could only have one it would definitely be wowcher .
I would love to try one of the holidays but have been scared to in case i cant get the dates i need , they always sound very tempting .
My product does not arrive
Good morning , I would know how long it will take yet ?
The data regarding purchases are .
the application number 100343320 and the number of screening GM555113775314707065 .
I was surprised how easy it was to use the website and some of the great deals I was able to find .
The process went smoothly and without a hitch and I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a good deal .
Great Service parcel arrived day after I placed the order !
I would recommend The Underfloor Heating Company to anyone as there web site is clear and gives you all the information you need .
They appear to have all the products you want to overcome any quirky design issue you may have and they stood by their promise and delivered the day after I placed the order .
One minor issue is that when the parcels arrived the black plastic around the pipe and edge insulation was badly ripped and the contents nearly fell out .
Just waiting for my builders to finish the roof of the Orangery so I can order the grooved insulation panels and self levelling screed .
ordered a sash for a bachelorette party .
arrived quickly and nicely packaged .
when I opened it I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it looked ...
I expected something cheesy looking but it was actually really cute !
I bought one with " bling " on it ...
I would highly recommend and/or order again !
Happy customer !
Denied me my " credit "
I was told in March 2013 that I had a year to use the credit I had on a return flight I cancelled .
I KNEW you all would find a way to deny me my credit and you did ... I found out , when I tried to USE it that it was a year from when I booked the flight ; which was January 2014 ... I will never use Travelocity again and I will advise all friends against it as well .
Flats are good , high heels are bad .
I liked the shopping experience the last few times I've shopped here .
However , the flats were the only shoes that seemed to not break .
I got a pair of high heels that broke after the first use .
I guess as long as you get the flats you're good to go .
LOVE our event flashdrive lanyards !
Enjoyed working with Flashbay to order USB/nametag/lanyards for an upcoming conference .
Their service was top notch -- quality and fast !
And the product is quality .
Will definitely be ordering from Flashbay in the future and passing their information on to others .
Why queue elsewhere when eTyres will come to you
What a pleasant experience !!
Gareth and Angela of eTyres Cardiff gave great advice about my tyre options , worked with me to source the best brand and model for my needs and then fitted them at home at a time to suit me - all for a fully inclusive price .
I would recommend eTyres to anyone who wants to avoid the hassle of waiting at a tyre retailer without paying extra for the privilege of a very personal service .
What a pleasure to do business with you - no trudging round shops for hours , ample choice and a fast and efficient delivery with the products in individual branded wrapping paper - and to top it all a couple of free chocolates included - very impressed .
Service , shipment , quality are very perfact
I just want to say a world all is very perfact !!
TV Lift Cabinet company has a great product but even greater customer service .
I have been extremely impressed at the helpfulness of this company 's customer service personnel .
They have responded and answered all questions with ease and no hassle .
I am awaiting to receive the Concord TV lift cabinet , and customer service has been very helpful in arranging the delivery to meet my time line .
This company has so far been far easy to work with , and I look forward to a great product to match
Good Service with only one minor problem ..... a lack of communication between shipsticks and the UPS carrier , no phone call from the driver , nothing ..... if was not for me to stay out of the house waiting for the truck to come by in the evening nothing would have happened .
Websites , emails , apps are great , but old school communication tools are essential to well serve the golf lovers community .
good job minus one small hangup
great job had one small issue with a backorder .
Good reliable service
Always had good quick service , product range can be a little limited at times , but prices at usually good .
Fast , easy , accurate and FUN !
You can't go wrong doing business with these folks !
Exceed My Expectations
I worked with web designer Dino Lau with Hot Doodle on my web design and I am extremely happy with my experience working with Dino and the final product Dino delivered .
Dino is patient , talented , resourceful , and he listened to my needs , responded quickly to all my requests , and went the extra mile to make me a happy customer .
Dino helped me realized my vision of the look and feel of my website .
I am grateful for his work and I highly recommend him to anyone who wants a professional website .
Thank you Dino !
Extremely fast service .
I ordered some items about 2pm one day and the were with me the following morning .
Not very impressed .
I was extremely disappointed with the delivery of some fence panels that I had delivered .
As I write this I am still waiting for their delivery .
These were ordered on the 16th of May .
Todays date 26 May .
I phoned Selections on the 25th to enquire where they were .
I got a silence then I got we have been busy , so they may take longer to get out to you , even though I had received an email stating they had been dispatched on the 20th , then another on the 23rd .
I then got as there was a short stock the could of sold out .
They said they would look into it and call me back .
I was told they had found the panels and they would package them up and send them out that day , so I would get them on the 26th .
What a surprise no panels .
So I hope I will get them tomorrow ??????
East ordering , great prices of parts and shipping !
Looking for auto parts ?
I know just the place .
They don't gouge you and you get free one-day shipping if you live around here !
I don't think I'll use local auto parts .
Boy the price was right , I saved at least $50 .
And was Happy with the tracking , and arrival of my new Radiator .
Good stuff Partsgeek .
Another Happy customer !
Patrick kane .
Boston Ma .
Great lessons and exceptional customer service
In two months time , I've learned to play three full songs .
The lessons are easy to follow and the teachers seem to really enjoy what they are doing .
I had raised a concern about the number of new lessons and a member of the team was very responsive to my needs .
I now understand that new lessons are added frequently .
Prompt delivery !
The rucksack I ordered arrived a couple of days earlier than estimated which was great , and it was in perfect condition .
I've bought from them several times .
The items arrive promptly and are very well packaged .
Unfriendly System for the refund of the core of an alternator
I bought an alternator from you and paid a deposit of around $67 for the core .
The deposit is supposed to be refunded to me upon the return of the core to you .
However your website and delivery documents do not give instructions how to return the core and how to get my deposit refunded .
bait and switch on vacation rental prices
I am not sure Travelocity has a hand in this , but I tried to book a vacation rental in the Hilton Head area .
I put in the required number of people , rooms needed , etc and up pops a weekly rate .
I tried to book , but instead received an email from the owner stating the actual price for the weekend is MUCH HIGHER than the Travelocity quote .
I found this to be true of all the properties I considered .
I got pretty discouraged and gave up the search .
Very good value
This is the fourth pair of spectacles I have ordered from SelectSpecs over the years and they remain great value .
Their customer service is good too .
There was a fault with my last pair where the pads separated from the bridge .
They asked me to upload a photo of the fault and within 24 hours they replied they were going to make me up a new pair .
Customers should realise that different types of glasses have different delivery times , however SelectSpecs have always delivered my rimless orders by the ten working days , i . e .
Super fast delivery and top quality
I ordered a small product and had it delivered within 18 hours .
I placed an order and it said it would arrive in 5 - 10 days ( I think , I don't quite remember .
Even so that 's a long time to wait ) and it didn't arrive until I called , twice .
I had waited 3 weeks and still nothing .
I've had this problem once before with N&J and I'm extremely annoyed about it .
I've actually recommended you to friends and family and now I look like a fool and it 's just embarrassing for me and for you .
However , I was given a full refund and you gave me the product for free with an apology .
For that I will continue using the service as I felt that was the courteous and right thing to do .
Just make sure it doesn't happen again .
Bully good deal on treats , and dog food prices are competitive .
I was more than pleased with the quality of the treats I got for Donatello .
I had been unable to find tendons locally .
Since moving I had not found a great pet store like I used to shop at , prices were over the top .
Pet Flow prices were competitive and the free shipping also helped , it turned out cheaper than the cost of food and gas to return to my previous store .
I will be ordering from them again .
Fantastic Customer Service !
I ordered an initial necklace for my daughter in law for Christmas .
The necklace shipped in plenty of time , but was lost by the USPS .
I contacted MyNameNecklace about it , and received feedback from a customer service rep within 24 hours , and continued to hear from the rep regularly .
I was issued a credit and the company put a trace on the necklace .
The necklace has been found and should arrive in the next few days .
I'm so pleased with the customer service I received !
Another order I placed arrived very timely and was an extremely pretty piece of jewelry .
I will definitely shop here again !
Great vendor , great prices
Found the item I wanted cheaper than Amazon !
Awesome first order !
I've been wanting some Shimano wheels for quite some time .
Finally found a great deal at Merlin with free shipping included .
How can you beat that ?
Why bother preorder a game if it comes after the release date ?
Ordered the game on a Saturday , so understandably it may be a little late .
I received a shipping email at 17:50 on the Monday , and with the game released on the Tuesday , how is that going to get to my door ?
The game finally came on Thursday .
So much for preordering .
Thanks a lot .
I Shall Return !
Timely , efficient , knowledgeable .
My sales person was Ty .
What a great asset to Town Fair Tires .
He was polite , patient and trustworthy .
Explained every thing clearly .
Alex who worked on my car was helpful as well .
I will continue to return and buy my tires there since I was treated so well today .
Best price on the TCP led bulbs I wanted .
TCP brand led bulbs , based on my experience with them and my research on the net ,
but they are pricey .
Pro lighting offered the best price and they delivered them promptly and safely packaged .
Everything was great
Service and product was very good .
Absolutely fabulous dog food delivery service !
I am so happy I tried PetFlow 's delivery service .
I no longer have to drive off to the pet store to get their food every 3-4 weeks .
Not only do I save gas , but I save the hassle of lugging the huge heavy bag in and out !
The delivery time is adjustable , and once you place your order , it is delivered promptly .
The price is similar to the pet stores , and I usually order a small treat or bag of cat food to make my order over 50 so I get free postage too .
I'm stuck on the service and will never go to a pet store again ; thanks PetFlow !
You've made my life simpler and I thank you for that !
Great prices and customer service
Apparel Deals is one of my favorite vendors .
I have ordered a couple of times from them already and I will continue to do so .
They do have a smaller selection than some other vendors .
However , almost all of the products I've ordered have been good quality and exactly described and pictured on their site .
Even when I have had to return something , it was hassle free and they were quick to respond .
What I really like is that they are always courteous and they will always find a way to work something out with you if there 's a problem .
One of the better suppliers for on-hand products and great customer service !
Excellent service at the right price
Ordered an exhaust manifold for a Trail Blazer and got it within a week .
That 's better than the dealer .
And the price was great , too .
Also better than the dealer and a local parts store .
All in all , this is the way t shop for car parts .
Excellent service as usual
Great prices with fast efficient delivery .
I have had great results buying from Pink Basis .
In fact I have given out their web address to 3 people in the last week .
I love shoes from AMIclubwear
I have had a great experience with every order I have received .
I've told a lot of people about your site , especially when I'm asked where I got those cute shoes .
Quick delivery , great value .
The website is really easy to use .
Communication is great I always know what 's happening with my order .
The really amazing thing though is the speed .
I place my order and my lenses arrive the next day everytime .
Terrible ( sentence not required )
You ask me to discuss to you , as I would with a friend , my perception of your services .
My bonding company needs my input for renewing my $10M in performance bonds .
I signed with you for my current fico 's & reports .
When I went to SCORES , it cleanly showed the ( 3 ) bureaus , side-by-side , with clear , large numbers .
When I try to print from that web page , I get a cheesy vertical set of numbers with very large options of membership that I already paid for .
I can't submit trash like this .
It looks like something a third tier rip-off would provide .
Before I go back t my previous credit monitoring company & canceling my payment to you , does anyone in your IT department have any corrective input ?
Fast , efficient , friendly , and cost efficient .
The guys were fast friendly efficient and professional .
The cost was way less than I expected… Overall a great experience .
very good rep . understanding and response .
This is one awesome business based on pure , old fashioned customer service .
I am in awe of how simply Matt and his wife have established a great business , offering great pricing , with love and care of their customers .
Their concept is amazing .
Show honest , caring feelings to be of service and help everyone eat better and they are pleased and so will you be when you develop a relationship with Raw Food World .
I will order again and again with confidence and trust and most of all , great karma !
Quick and easy
Recieved my parcel on time , nothing bad to say at all .
Easy to use website !
I love using hostels.com to book hostels around the world .
I use it every time I travel abroad .
It 's easy to use , and the information found within it is accurate and very informative .
Best prices !
I try to find the best price for the product I am interested in and they beat every time !
It would be very nice if they offered free shipping sometimes because that is the only reason I will go to a different site !!
And now , you need to add a new product called DFine8 , great stuff !
Beautiful , looked like the arrangement pictured on the website .
When purchasing flowers online , there is always a worry that the bouquet won't look as good as the ones displayed on the website .
I am pleased to say this wasn't the case .
The flowers ordered looked fabulous .
Thank you Serenata Flowers for a beautiful arrangement .
Had the Hard to Find Ballast
They were the only outlet that had the hard to find ballast for my under-cabinet lighting .
They completed my order in a fast and professional manner .
got my ' 51 Ford running five days before I thought I would !
PartsGeek has shown much better on-line service than other older and more well known on-line parts stores , and the parts I ordered were delivered at least a week before I expected !
Thanks , PartsGeek !
Easy to put together , plenty of adjustments to suit most people , and a good price .
I have made several purchases from B & H , and I have been satisfied with every deal .
My husband gave me his wishlist and I had no problems getting what he wanted ... simple !
no phone or real person to talk to = SCAMMERS
all my parts never came and i got charged
Great product fantastic service
Ordered keo cleats cheapest on the net really quick delivery .
Everything you look for in an online company they delivered .
The item I ordered was on sale , there was a free gift with it , delivery was free and delivered within 2 days .
Customer Service responded immediately when I needed help .
You could not ask for more , well done - happy customer .
Excellent products and customer service .
Fast delivery .
I had messed up my order when creating it online .
Barringtons could not have been more helpful .
I was amazed how good they were .
Very rare to get such good service these days , I would definitely use them again for that reason .
Suprised at the wonderful response and caring assistance !
IF YOU NEED INK CARTRIDGES , CONTACT NO ONE ELSE BUT INKFARM !
ALTHOUGH I HAD A COUPLE OF CARTRIDGES THAT DID NOT PERFORM AS EXPECTED ( REFILLS ) , INKFARM HAS REPLACED THEM QUICKLY AND WITHOUT THE USUAL UNFULLFILLED PROMISES OF MOST COMPANIES .
ALWAYS A PLEASURE DEALING WITH THEM .
Everything went as planned
From the reservation to the arrival , everything went as planned .
very good service .
Fair prices .
Cannot fault the Company . Hopefully the Company will continue to maintain its High standard of customer service .
Well done .
Customer service not helpful
I book a hotel in Vegas for three nights .
When I checked out I out in the promo code " vegas25 " which should have deducted $25 off ; however it did not .
I called and the costomer service rep told me she could not help me --- all I could not was cancel my reservations and rebook but I would be charged $19 !
Not worth it .
Without the discount it would have come out cheaper on hotels .
Com or travelocity but what really bothers me was the unhelpful spirit of the customer service rep !
Unlucky with wrong product sent but good Customer Service in resolving !
Wrong image was linked to the product and the item that was delivered not as shown .
Customer Services have offered full refund ( inc return postage ) and have apologised for their error .
Unfortunate and inconvenient transaction but won't put me off trying them again due to level of aftersales !
Great Company for all your towing accessories
Towequipe have many very reasonbly price products for all your towing needs and i have no complaints about the company .
However the delivery company they use really let them dowm badly .
It took two attempts to actually get the product i ordered .
Even after clearly stating the times that i was available at my work address and wanting for only me to sign for the product the delivery driver never even asked for me ( it didnt help he couldnt speak any english )
I would definately use Towequipe again when there is a product i want that they sell without a second thought .
Quick replacement part , works fine .
The part we needed was easy to locate on the website , it was quickly delivered , and I was able to fit the new seal in less than a minute ; and it works !
How 's that for efficiency ?
Fast efficient service .
Anything ordered with Just Kampers seems to arrive on your doorstep immediately .
It 's a shame other sites can't work this well - and the product is always sturdily packaged .
This " firm " took over supply without authority and proceeded to harass and lie .
The telephone staff are very very rude and the emails are almost as bad .
They believe they can simply bully you into what they want without a care in the world .
Dont even think about going to them ...........
This is a family business thats put service first .
I placed an order inquiry and recieved a phone call back very quickly in deed with all the information i required in a very honest manner .
I would recommend them without hesitation .
Cowboy Telecoms !
12 months into our 24 month deal they have hiked the price by 40% !
these cowboys are just unbelievable .
the price is still the same on the website but it seems they fund this by ripping off existing customers .
one year into our contract and Chess are still the biggest mistake we have ever made .
The initial sales team tell tall tales about high service but LIE about contract small print and horrendous exit claus .
They promised us a seamless switch over on a preset date .
The day came and went with no switch over or any contact from Chess .
After numerous chases they gave a further date but no explanation or apology for the delay .
The new date came and our broadband switched off from the old provider .
Chess did not however switch on .
Several telephone calls later at Rip Off rates we still didint get anywhere or get any of the call backs promised .
Our whole office lost 1 & 1/2 days work ( we work 100% in the cloud ) before we got connected .
We have made formal complaints but they havent even bothered to respond so we are now going to the Ombudsman ( CISAS) .
If you are thinking about joining them DONT !
If everything goes ok you might be ok but if you depend on a service DONT even think about Chess as Customer Service isnt on their agenda .
Rubbish - could they be any worse ??
a flashy website but that 's as far as it goes .
high prices and complicated disount code rules .
very slow delivery and poor quality packaging .
Beware when things go wrong the customer service is dreadful and downright rude .
Look elsewhere !
Great for the easily fooled !
You can make money from the site if your selective and know what your doing .
However a very big but is that the links often take you to special pages which don't enjoy the usual discounts and often Higher prices than if you went direct to the end site .
So it looks good if you earn £10 or even £100 but if you unknowingly paid £15 or £150 more than the best price before the cash back then guess what ...?
Yes you lose money !
I have also noticed the amount paid is often less than promised and confirmed on email statements but after waiting 6 - 12 months most people don't realise .
So it can be useful but buyer beware ......
Great value service
A great price and 1st class service !
Found the items we wanted very easily .
They arrived as promised , they then told me when they were coming on the day of delivery and then emailed me to let me know they had arrived .
With that type of service I couldn't be anything less than pleased .
My experience with the team at Optima
Brooke I wanted to send you this short note to let you know how happy I have been you and your team at Optima Tax Relief .
I am impressed with your businesslike approach which has moved the process along at a consistent pace but has not pressured me into moving forward until I have been fully informed and comfortable moving to the next step .
It is reassuring to know that I have Optima tax relief on my side as I clear up my tax situation .
Timely delivery of goods as ordered

A must have for all with foreign contacts
Talk quality ,
Talk convenience ,
Customer service ,
Fair rates ,

Fast Efficient service !
Love this top but sizing seems to be an issue with the manufacturer , NOT Redding Medical 's problem .
The medium was HUGE , like an extra large , and the small is just a tiny bit snug .
Oh well .
Overall great service .
GREAT PRICE , too .
Very competitive .
I got the best price
RIckson was very friendly and tried to get me the best price on the tires I wanted
zip code wrong and some parts also wrong
service one of the persons there even said I was the one that put the wrong info .
even so i got my original print out of the order with the right info .
in it i just finished talking to cust service about those wrong parts I was told they would ship the right one right away so for now i will wait and hope I get the right ones this time
excellent service , had an issue and it was resolved quickly and with no problems .

Great service from infloorpoolparts.com for replacement parts for my in the floor cleaning system .

All the necessary information/instruction to complete the installation of what could be an intimidating task .
Cool Sunglasses and Cheap Price
I purchased two sunglasses for one classic metal aviator other one wayfarer for my vacation .
They were UV400 protected and had nice built quality .
Website easy to navigate and organized based on men and women glasses .
Gr8 experience will shop again .
Excellent customer service .
I will be recommending Country Attire , they are simply a very professional company who were very happy to help when others werent .
As promised , great way to get your passport fast with no hassle .
Thanks William Weaver for making it effortless .
Prompt delivery , quality product
Ordered a pc on Dinopc for my wife .
Chose a suitable base build ( quad core amd ) and then customised a bit here and there ( more RAM , better graphics card) .
Was expecting 2 week turnaround , but received email to inform me of delivery after 6 days !
Turned up nicely packaged and all worked out of the box .
Wife is very pleased with her new pc - I'm very pleased with the performance at the price .
My first choice from now on
I've been looking for certain style Oakleys for a while and none of my local stores had either the style I wanted or for a price I was willing to pay .
So I turned to the internet ... Google threw me to sunglassesshop.com .
All the glasses I wanted in one place , with very reasonable shipping and prices !
AND they had a -20% sale going on .
It took me maybe 2 mins to have the Oakleys I wanted heading my way ...
Needless to say , I'll be back .
Easy and Accurate
Easiest thing I ever did on line .
I was sent to a creditor that was very professional and answered all my questions .
I was not going to sign the loan because I could not get the amount I wanted due to stated regulations , but the call I received was so professional and non-aggressive that I went ahead and signed for a smaller amount .
The T shirts were all I expected and everyone loved them .
They are awesome
Very prompt confirmation and delivery of order
The website was user friendly , transaction was very smooth and delivery was on time .
I will do business with you again .
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
I purchased tailgate cables for my 2005 Tacoma from parts geek .
The part was listed to fit 2005-2013 .
I received them and they were 3/4 inch too long .
I contacted both parts geek and dorman to verify if that was the correct part and both stated yes .
I went to my local Toyota dealer and purchased one cable and it fit .
It was 3/4 inch shorter than the one from parts geek .
I got my RMA # from parts geek and they stated they would NOT refund the original shipping cost because dorman says they fit .
The part does not fit and Toyota looked at it and verified that it was too long .
So I got screwed on 8.95 shiping and 6.50 to send it back .
PG said too bad for me .
THEY SUCK !!!!!
buy from here !
Bought couple of pairs of insoles from here .
Not only are they very good value , they came really quickly .
Worth bookmarking the company for future purchases !
Recommended to me ... met expectations , great service
Ordered some protein and it came quickly , at time requested .
Already about to order another item ...
Med balls that are different !
Bought Gymnastic 2kg and 3kg med balls + resistance band from Vivomed as they were a good price .
Delivered really quickly .
Haven't yet used the resistance bands but the med balls are great !
Not only feel great texture , but smaller size works well for many exercises where you hold onto the ball ( rather than slam it , where I don't find the size of ball makes much difference) .
Will definitely use Vivomed again .
excelent quality and perfect shipping
I am a retailer and personal shopper with 20 years experience , Muubaa is one of my favorite lines .
The quality of goods is exceptional .
Shipping is perfect !
Brilliant , quick lenses sent to your door
Lenstore are efficient and always get my order right - unlike my local opticians .
They also deliver extremely quickly - again unlike my local opticians .
Worst customer service ever , just big bullies !!
they pick and choose which models to fine , for example fisting is not allowed so if you put it in your topic you get fined 5000 tokens , meanwhile there is a model with the name fistingreally , then if you try and dispute it they fine you more , their customer service picks and chooses which emails to answer , so if they don answer and you send another one , bam !!!
another fine , I lost 10 000 tokens in a 2 day span , thats 500 dollars , all because i knew the first fine i received was false , i asked for proof an never got a response so after 2 emails they fined me again and shut down my account .
all because i questioned the first fine , so not only did i get no answer i lost 500 dollars and my web page , its hard enough to make money , the webpage takes 50% and then to get fined for something you did not do is ridiculous .
basically the customer service people use the rules to their discretion so they people that make them money dont get fined , i would give the no stars if i could , no phone number and no manager to talk to , just bullies !!
The name is true .
easy to book
It was very easy and the rate is good .
One comment , I have looked at the rate in euro , and when I booked , the booking was in GBP , and when I transformed again in euro I have found 20 euro more .
friends advice and previous use of beck arnley products ....
Having been using beck arnley products for years I took my friends advice and purchased beck arnley antifreeze for both my lexus and toyota vehicles.....can't say enough about beck arnley .... in every facet ....
Furniture delivered when scheduled .
All in perfect condition .
Thought that the delivery crew were going to unpack the items on delivery .
I may have been mistaken or misheard when purchasing the goods in the shop .
Not a good experience
I thought I was calling the Marriott Reservation line and must have clicked on this link in error .
This was one of the worst experiences in trying to reserve a room .
The agent was not picking up on any verbal cues .
I told him multiple times that it was late and only needed a room to bunk for the night - didn't need to know about amenities or want to engage in dialogue about where I was from and what I was doing .
These agents must be told to read from a script .
Very frustrating .
I will make sure to program the Marriott Reservation number into my phone to not make this mistake again .
Great products and excellent service !
Great products and excellent service !
quick delivery - well packaged - very satisfied
I have now bought a few items and must say I'm impressed with the service and quality of products .
Once again I have not been let down , very quick delivery , good communication with emails , which let you know when it 's dispatched , and delivery date etc .
thanks again for the great service and will recommend to friends .
Horrible customer service and shipping
A few months ago I ordered bully sticks and trachea treats.....couldn't pass up the deal .
Anyway , I was a little appalled by the way they arrived .
Literally just thrown in a cardboard box .
I thought that was a little odd .... they are unprotected from any moisture or elements or bugs that may get into the package .
So I shrugged my shoulders and forgot about it .
Weeks later I order another shipment of bully sticks and trachea ..... and they arrived the same way .... just thrown in a cardboard box BUT this time they were infested with ants !
Sad part is that I did not notice that right away ( the ants were inside the box ) and I brought the box in my house !
To my dismay ..... as I opened the box and was greeted by movement I screeched .
I threw the box and contents outside and immediately called the customer service # The gentleman was very understanding and noted all my concerns ( though I thought) .
He told me that he would put my statement in the feedback and make note of the request of the handling on a new shipment of my identical order .
Good I thought ..... until I received another shipment with THE ITEMS JUST THROWN IN THE CARDBOARD BOX !
I am a veterinarian and have a lot of clients .... I will never recommend this company !
great prices , good products
This site offers the best discounts that you can find on the internet in the bodybuilding supplement industry !
bad bad bad
well all i can say is use regular shipping no 2 day or overnight .
Good quality , good design and good fit !
These were a Christmas present for my son Kieran who has been dancing for a number of years and has just recently started on the DPA open circuit .
He absolutely loved them - even better because a couple of weeks later at Champions of Tomorrow in Blackpool he came 1st !
Now the shoes are seen as a bit of a lucky charm !
Whilst these shoes are more expensive than those he has had previously , you pay for what you get and the shoes are much better quality and more comfortable fit !
I would highly recommend this website for any one looking for reliable and very reasonably priced products ..
The delivery was very fast also
I wanted to get a piñata for my sons birthday ..
I ordered it on a Wednesday and it was on my doorstep the following morning at 8.00 am
The piñata was great and the kids really enjoyed it .
Would highly recommend ' the big party '
FANTASTIC , QUICK AND GREAT PRICES

Good prices , excellent service

Fast postage , so no long frustrating waits .
My personal favourite products are 5.11 , Heinnie Haynes have a great range stocked as well as other great manufacturers .
Will be checking back soon for all my smart fuctional everyday wear .
Helped me find the best cash back credit card .
I'm planning a remodel and will be making a lot of purchases in the next few months so wanted to make sure I have the best credit card .
I used their cash back calculator and found out that I could be earning a lot more cash back with a different card .
As the saying goes ..... always late .......
Ordered a part for my car on 02/14/14 , didn't ship until 02/18/14 and I received it on 02/25/14 .
Why pay $10 for shipping if it is going to take almost two weeks to receive the part .
I was better off going to AutoZone and paying $20 more for the part and have it the same day !
not good , you sent me the wrong size !
i was not happy with the teds socks that I received .
I ordered a medium and received a small which did not fit .
I will return them when I get a chance
Lovely choices of furniture
Lovely furniture and a great deal to choose from
Top quality products & super-fast shipping

No need to surf the web looking for the best prices .
They are here .
So excited with my purchases .
Already used my nail polish .
Went on smooth .
Fast service .
Great products .
You just gotta try them .
Good Price - Quick Delivery
Snapped my old racket and a needed a replacement quickly without paying too much .
Came within a few days and racket was exactly what I needed , great stuff !
Satisfied despite online reviews
I was pleased with how fast my part got to me , took about 3 or 4 days from when I had ordered it .
I have no complaints other than packaging was not good at all .
Looked as though the box fell off a mountain and somehow managed to survive in one piece ... Luckily the item in the box wasn't harmed or damaged in any way .
This is why I give it 4 stars not 5 .
it does what it says on the label
I would recommend this company to any one who requires a fair price for printer inks .
The quality is good and delivery is cheap and efficient and at the prices that the company charges you can afford to keep some spare ink in stock
Thanks Lenstore - I can see !
The Lenstore is great , affordable and very fast .
Both times I have ordered from them , my contacts have arrrived in maybe 5 days from the date I ordered them .
They arrived , sooner then I expected and sooner then the " scheduled " delivery .
Fast , affordable quality prodicts with grreat service , m what more could you ask for !
Awesome Service !!
Got my part sooner then expected also the cheapest price of all the other parts store .
Two thumbs up !
Will use again
booking made easy
Easy booking proceedure even from Australia .
One draw back site asked for a car registration number which was difficult to give when we will be picking up a hire car when we arrive in the UK in amomths time

Really good store for all your pen needs .
Fast delivery and great tracking after shipping .

B&H Photo has been a source of good products very good prices and fast delivery .

Purchased a Readfield Rifle scope best price on internet .
When you go shopping on the internet make sure you stop at B&H Photon you will not be disappointed .
My part arrived via ground shipping in two days and I live in a remote area .
It was $50 less than the dealer price and it was an original equipment part .
It fit perfectly and fixed the problem .
I will definitely be going to Parts Geek for my parts in the future .
Fantastic service at reasonable prices should be your motto .
Awesome deal on my mini vacation !!!
I love booking through bookit.com no matter how many sites I visit I always get the best deal through them .
It is fast and they has so much information available .
Love wouldn't book any other way .
Faultless service .
Ordering is easy .
They always seem to have whatever you want in stock and it 's shipped out the same day .

Had a misfire on my 2006 BMW , resulting in the need to replace ignition coil .
BMW Dealer cost approximately $450-500 for one coil replacement .
Bought 6 new coils & replaced all 6 spark plugs ( nearly at 100k miles so time to change ) with 2 day shipping for $277 from PartsGeek . com and changed them all myself , saving potentially thousands .
Car is running perfectly and its all thanks to parts geeks prices , high quality parts , and fast shipping .
Will definitely shop with again .
Quick and seamless
I wish I have found about this site sooner ... could have saved me some cash :)
Very efficient and fast service
I identified the part that needed replacement , did a search online for the part and this site came up trumps and after ordering the site kept me up to date with the delivery and all the info was spot on and delivery arrived on schedule .
POWERFUL and yet USER FRIENDLY
every since i found about cdkeys.com on facebook , it 's the number one and the first place i went to search for games since its a lot cheaper them main stream , and now i'll jus consider buying PSN point from cdkeys instead of buying games direct from PSN , as well as many other pc games , i jus wish that there could be more Mac games avilable , since i am using a mac as well ,
cdkeys.com , ur very first option to start looking for games !
From my first interaction with Blackcircle.com 's website to having tyres fitted at my local garage of choice everything was clearly explained and professionally executed .
Top marks !
Poor customer Service
You cheated me both in product and money .
Your company is out to take advantage of other .
I will never shop at yr site .
I ordered my initial 's for Visconti My Pen System and a convertor .
Items were resonably priced and arrived quickly , the Initials look lovely on my pen .
I would deal with Cult Pens again and would recommend them .
Best in class !
The shopping experience at West Coast Shaving has been wonderful .
The selection of items was great , the website was easy to navigate , the order was easy to place , and my order arrived right on time .
I order about 6 months worth of supplies at a time and the free shipping is a great perk .
Bookbyte is cheap and awesome :)
I order all my books from Book byte.com .
I also sell them my books that I don't need !!
When I have any concerns or problems , they work hard to make me happy and that 's important to me .
This is the way a business should be run !
Easy to order , resonable price , great qualitly , perfect fit , NO --- B . S .....
Used once will use again if needed ... NO problems ..... ordered replacement tail light assemble , this unit better quality than OEM part !!!
Overall , a good site
The prices are good and I like the point system .
The only issue is that the last time I ordered , it didn't recognize that I already had an acct .
from the past .
( I forgot ) So when I checked out I didn't get points .
It should recognize by the email .
excellent service !
The shipping was fast .
The product was 30 Ellen and as ordered .
I would most definitely purchase from again .
Always have what I am looking for , and great prices .
Too busy to go to stores and this website is answer to my problem !
Good deals with catches
We were thinking Priceline was THE answer until they booked us a room at a hotel that had only smoking rooms left !
So that leaves very mixed feelings cuz we've done great with Priceline .
Nice hotels , good prices , but if there 's anything I can't stand its a smoky room !
Will think carefully before using Priceline again
Good Quality Hoodie
Bought this in lilac which is a lovely colour .
Really thick but soft fleece .
Only thing I would say is they come up small .
Bought a large in the end and I am normally a size 10/12 !
Don't know if this is usual sizing for Superdry as its the first item I have bought from them
Great way to get Debit cards
This is the first time I've used the site and placed an order .
I liked how I can personalize a card .
easy to navigate and fast service
Got my purchase with in a few days .
Im a returned shopper and will be shopping again when needed .
GREAT SERVICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Our order arrived in two days -- UNBELIEVABLE ----- It included a new radiator for a Hyundia ( no small feat supplying that ) which fit perfectly --- Thanks for a Great Shopping experience ................
Dick S .
The package came earlier than the expected date of delivery .
My daughter is fairly satisfied with the costume .
However , the wig that came with it is very fragile and almost falling apart .
We got what we paid for .
Got the books in a reasonable time and as described .
excellent products and service
Correct parts arrived quickly for a great price .
The order process was easy to understand .
The price was very good .
The parts arrived quickly and fit correctly when installed .
Fast and easy
My husband is in the military and we had to find a storage unit at the last minute .
This website was fast , easy and gave us all the options we needed to find the best unit to meet our needs .
Excellent everything !
They always have what I need .
Super competitive pricing .
If I order in the morning I get it the next day with standard shipping !
Nothing to complain about .
Fantastic product , i love my juicer !
Product was delivered abroad free of charge and arrived in great shape .
Tried it immediately and absolutely love the juices the juicer produces .
Woul definetly recommend this product and the seller !
color good , but defective
Loved the glasses , but where the jewels are at , the one side had a lot of glue all over .
I tried scraping it off as much as I could .
The other side was good .
My experience with Parts Geek was great .
I will refer & use Parts Geek in the future to family and friends .
Excellent products , value for money and very prompt and quick service .
Have used RAWK for many orders and I am extremely pleased with the products and the service provided .
Would highly recommend this company to everyone .
Excellent - thank you !
Top Quality Service and Excellent Price
I have ordered three things from Appliances Online over the past 8 months ( everything broke one after the other ) and have had nothing other than great prices and excellent customer service .
I have always gone for free delivery and on each occasion have received a recorded message to say the approximate time of delivery ( usually a four hour slot ) and then the actual deliver driver will call to say exactly what time he will be arriving .
They deliver the appliances with the minimum of fuss and take away your old stuff for a tenner .
Seriously wouldn't use anybody else for electrical equipment ever again .
Have recommended them to everybody .
I want to know if it is possible to pay the room only in cash rather than with credit card because of the inconvenience of repayment to card at here
Thank you for your thoughtful and considerate service and I think I will order the room with your website for another time
I receive my items it good condition and it kind of took longer than I thought , but the tracking code helped a lot .
Items were great and they're so cute .
I love it !
I actually bought them so I can wear them this winter so far I only wore the dress .
I have wore the 2 skirts but they're in a great condition when I got them .
On time delivery , everytime !!
Tennisnuts is by far the best tennis website there is .
Some tennis sites nay find it cheaper but tennisnuts always delivers on time .
To me that is all that matters .
Good serves .
Very quick , efficient and excellent service at a very competitive price
will use again next time i require oil ...
Great to deal with
Stockwise was the only people with the part I needed .
I would highly recommend them !
Shipping was faster then anticippated .
Quick Ship - Good Quality
The book was shipped quickly and was decent quality for a rental .
The only downside was that I needed to return the book for a refund due to dropped course and the return/refund process is very week .
You have to send an email to get the return information .
There is no process in place for easy returns .
Compared to other book buying/renting sites , this site is very weak there .
This is very good company
I received email said my iphone was unlock
I inserted sim card then call my tmobile
then 1 minute late
my phone is working very good
I visited pet supermarket for the first time before Christmas as was pleasantly surprised at the great value for money products think you need to try it for yourself

recommended by a friend am totally satisfied with experience
Good price seen better quality
The price I paid was a great deal .
Unfortunately they really did not match up with exactly what I was hoping for .
No options for different formats .
Pen write nicely .
They shipped my items on time and delivered quickly .
No complaints at all .
Quick and convienent .
Unexpected , I , ve had Quality , Customer Service and Reliability for 3 dollars a month !!
For 3 dollars a month , I can't believe the value and satisfaction I , ve received from Phone Power !
Never been more impressed with an online retailer .
Free shipping that arrives within a day or 2 .
That 's was a dream when I ran out of an immuneO powder that really has changed my health .
Thank you for being such an assertive company .
Great Product and Service
I ordered a photobook from Jessops .
The editing software was fantastic and the book came promptly .
The book was excellent and my holiday pics looked superb .
I would definitely order another photobook from them .... also will upgrade from my phone camera to a proper one to make the most of my picture taking endeavours .
Well done Jessops !
simple and effective service
Having compared prices I opted for skyparks .
Nice and simple to use and booking was completed in a matter of minutes followed with a swift confirmation via email .
Product delivered promptly as ordered .
Roll of mailing labels
The most useful single source for travel information
Whether it 's a foreign country , a hotel or a restaurant , Tripadvisor 's member based evaluations provide me with a reliable guide .
The combination of averaged ratings by hundreds of members and specific reviews is unbeatable .
great service !
I appreciated the ease of ordering , the discount on some expensive dog food and how fast the package came !
Simple , straightforward site , even for a technophobe like me !
Fast results and easy to read .
Very well laid out website and VERY user friendly !
The water has landed .
The order , received yesterday , was correct and timely .
Fast service and economical prices .
I love the low prices and the accuracy of my order and the fast shipping was very nice .
I don't recommend pcgamesupply.com at all ..
I used to have a good experience with pcgamesupply.com , but not any more .
I'm an Australian user with a valid address and a valid phone number , but every time I place any order my account got suspended/blocked for a week !!!!!
I could't contact any of their customer service representatives !!
every time I open a ticket I got a reply from a bot !
Good price .
Quick delivery .
Quality product .
The price was competitive and there was a good range to choose from .
No problems with the ordering and delivery process and we were very happy with the tennis racket .
Great choices .
I always like the options it gives me .
Saves me a lot of money .
Its prices are always better then the corporate discounts I get from my organization .
a really fast service
i was pleased to recieve my order so fast , and a little bonus
included as well , thank you will use you again .
Good quality .
Value for money .
The painting I ordered for my living room was delivered today .
Though I am not a big fan of reproductions in general , I decided to go for the Dance at Bougival ( artist , Pierre Auguste Renoir ) reproduction since I absolutely love that piece of art .
I was a bit unsure earlier but now that I see it , I realize that this is a beautifully done piece and I really wish to congratulate the artist on his immaculate attention to detail .
I will order a graffiti piece for my teenager’s room next .
Totally Loved It .
Results Are Real And Amazing .
I first came across some supplements from Sports Food on amazon.com while idly browsing for some weight loss options for myself .
I googled them and sure enough , I found their site .
After a few minutes into browsing the site , I decided to try out their green tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it .
I was not exactly expecting great results but it worked for me .
Not only did I lose 3.5 pounds in the first two weeks , more importantly it made me much more alert and energetic which is a big thing for a mother of 3 young kids .
Since the product was moderately priced it was perfect for a trial and when it worked for me , I also introduced my husband to it .
Once he had lost a few measly pounds , he took the big plunge and decided he would go head-on into dieting and muscle building so that his flab can once again faintly resemble a stomach .
Accordingly , he is planning to order few muscle building supplements once he has lost some more weight and settled into a good gym routine .
We also tried their Fat burner which was on a special offer .
Though it did not suit me much since my digestive system could not take it , my husband found it to be extremely effective .
I am happy with the slow and steady green tea and would recommend Sports Food products to anyone who is looking to lose weight .
Their website is easy to browse and their selection of products just perfect – not too few , yet not so many that you get lost in the details .
The product are usually dispatched the same day and reaches within 2-4 days .
The support staff is polite and helpful .
What more could you want ?
Good Job .
Excellent support .
I was looking for someone to help with my debt problems .
I am glad I chose Scottish Trust .
They provided me seamless support and realistic advice .
The staff is polite and they made sure I understood the choices I had , while also mentioning their own recommendations .
I highly recommend these guys .
Not what I thought
I thought I was booking directly with the hotel but got Expedia instead .
I got the phone number off the internet , and the banner made it seem like it was the hotel 's central booking number .
The reversationist said they were out of the block of rooms for the wedding I was attending and I'd have to go up a level , Which , he assured me , was a MUCH better room and the rate included everything .
I got billed on my credit card for the whole amount ( which was $60 more than I was quoted) .
When I called the hotel directly ( once again getting the number off the internet , but it was the right one ) they told me I'd booked with expedia .
Not happy that I was not told right away that it was not the Renaissance Hotel booking site .
Arizona to Amsterdam in a few key strokes !
This was my first time ordering flowers internationally .
I couldn't have been more pleased with the follow up and delivery .
The quality of the arrangement that our friends received was excellent .
I would definitely use FloraQueen again in the future and can recommend it to friends .
As described on the website - everything went perfect !
Perfect , no problem .
Sent phone Next Day Delivery on a Wednesday and money was in the bank on Thursday !
I work in eCommerce and am vary rarely impressed ( or leave reviews) ; but well done .
Genuinely impressed .
High-quality fixtures at great prices
I was skeptical of Hudson Reed at first but decided to give them a try anyways .
I'm very glad I did .
Their fixtures are top notch quality at great prices .
Solid brass internals , fully polished chrome finish .
These are heavy , quality pieces .
Customer service was great too .
Follow-up emails were sent promptly and delivery was very quick .
I will definitely be buying from them again for my next project .
Very helpful every step of the way
Gary was very helpful and clearly communicated the process .
He answered every question I had quickly and sufficiently .
Light Assembly Replacement
The replacement assembly came packaged without any damage and arrived in a timely manner which enabled me to quickly interchange and repair the defective assembly on my Dodge Grand Caravan .
Fantastic service and easy to track progress .
If you have .
a phone to sell use envirofobe .
You are taken through the process step by step .
You can access the progress and status of the sale on your account .
I went Ion line on Tuesday to value my phone by the following Thursday the money was in my account .
Five star service I have already recommended to friends .
Excellent - Quick order , quick delivery
Website is easy and quick .
One less thing to worry about .
your customer service closed the deal for me
not a big storyteller .... but I got a good deal at a nice hotel ... I will use it again for sure .
Superb service from start to finish
Very happy with the service received , couldn't really ask for more .
Easy , affordable parcel delivery ?
It 's here !
I found the Interparcel website really easy to use .
Pop in the source and destination and weight and dimensions of the parcel if known and you get a list of quotes to choose from , ordered clearly by service type .
Some other aggregators seem to have services and providers dotted around all over the page , but these results are really easy to navigate .
I'd definitely recommend them .
Great range , great service , great prices
I generally don't fill out these vendor reviews , but I've used DV for years online and over the phone and think others should know how good they are .
They have a really wide range of goods available and some of the lowest prices to be found on the web .
Their online service is so quick and easy .
Almost too easy !!
On the phone they've been knowledgable , helpful and courteous .
Delivery has always been prompt and the courier they use usually sends texts to give the hour of delivery , which is really good .
Overall , then , a top notch service that sets a high standard for the online shopping user experience .
The right part at the right price !
This was my first time using PartsGeek , and will use them again !
Need a taillens for a Ford F150 , found it on PartsGeek for tess than I was able to find on eBay !
Everything worked like it was suppose to .
Great Prices and Service !
Office 13 product was delivered as promised .
Does what it says on the tin ,
Fabulous product .
Company kept me fully informed of my products whereabouts .
Fitters were on time and very polite .
Fitted and connected my appliance with mo problems .
Money did not leave my account until 2 days later .
Would definitely use this company again and fully recommend it .
Well done !
your company ozzes awesomeness
Very very happy , ordered hoodie on thursday from australia , arrives monday = brilliance , perfect fit thank you very much superdry .
I like the parts that i bought ,
i will recommend this website for anybody who wants car parts .
Very good prices and fast delivery .
Great service - even through the rain .
My fiance and I used the Big Bus Tour service while in London recently and were very pleased with the operation .
Even though it had rained on both days of our 48 hour ticket , including a trip to Greenwich , the ride was wonderful .
There are many places where the bus stops and all very convenient to find .
We had ordered our tickets in advance and only had to show up at the stop of our choice .
This is a great way to see the city and get oriented before heading out on your own .
Will use it again .
Much better value than Nissan OEM !
I ordered the radiator/engine splash guard .
The quality is there on the material !!
However the fitment is a bit off , but nothing major .
I had to cut a little bit of material and voila .
Still a bargain !!
If youre debating wether to order or not ... just buy it and dont go give your money to the stealership .
The most helpful worker i have run into in months of being a customer
Shaela is like one of the coolest and nicest person that works at public storage .
Anytime i have a problem she always help me solve it if not handle the matter personally herself .
She moved to another location and i will follow ...
Easy to use
I like travelocity because it 's easy to use and I think their prices are competitive .
These guys ship fast , have the best pricing on bsn and gives you free stuff .
My only gripe is shipping can be high .
Service great !
My car tire type not instock .
The service was great , folks there are extremely polite and professional .
My situation was last minute , two of my tires had bubbles forming on thee sidewall .
They unfortunately did not have any run flats in my tire size , being a Saturday at 1:00 pm , I understand .
Fortunately I had 3 spare and a extra rim .
Guess what , I had a cracked rim on the car which they found and showed me .
They put my spare tires on and then found a nail in a third tire , that being the tire that had a cracked rim .
That was not a stock item for them either .
They identified my issues and got me going down the road .
I plan on going back soon and ordering a new set .
But I still shall keep a spare or two in my barn .
You never know .
Decent cash for old books , Dvds , & CDs relatively fast
The site and process works pretty easily .
The site is one of the few I found that buys CDs and DVDs as well as books , and they even took a few books that some other sites would not .
That being said , it is a shame that there are many books that they don't accept at all .
It is sad when one buys a $30 book and later no one will even offer you 10 cents for it .
I should add that the other book buying sites online wouldn't buy those books either .
One peculiar issue is that when you are given the digital copy of the shipping label - it is only 1/4 size and you have to figure out how to expand it before you print it off .
The shipping is offered as by USPS or Fed Ex , and payment is either PayPal or by a paper Check .
Straighforward , efficient and reasonably priced
I've not ordered much from Garden4less but when I have , the service has been good , the delivery prompt and the order has been exactly as promised at a reasonable price .
Delivery as promised ; delivery time within the promised hour ; jacket as ordered .
Perfect fit .
What more could one ask ?
A company that really seems to know the meaning of service .
works that is all good
Received my order on time , in the past I call them up got great service and helpful opinions and information on my purchases .
I would highly recommend this site
very user friendly
5-star service at the lowest prices on the web !
Extremely courteous and friendly staff .
Very easy to navigate website .
Super fast shipment .
Lowest price !
Will be back for more .
Best price available on the internet plus free shipping .
Order shipped and arrived quickly , well packaged and as described .
Would absolutely recommend and use them again .
It 's worth the time ..
I love the price match ..
Good quality and fast delivery
My husband got in a minor accident where only his grill cracked .
Parts Geek had the part not only less expensive than everyone else , but the processing and delivery time was quick .

super quick delivery 1st class co
I would definitely use this company again
Very well run great costumer service !
I've given you a 4/5 and not a 5/5 from one simple problem for me and that 's the system limit .
you run everything very well sometimes need to wait just a little bit to get the item but overall a+
Fantastic coat and a brilliant price !!
My other half loved it , she works with horses and knows a good quality product , and the coat was just that !!!
Very happy customer
Delivery was on time and my phone arrived in excellent condition .
Courier left the package with a neighbour as requested .
Note left to confirm delivery to neighbour as well as an email .
Product delivered quickly and in good condition .
Appears to be of good quality .
I give it a 4.5 Star - ALMOST perfect for MY needs
I work at a University and we have several vehicles that we manage for multiple campuses .
Using this system saves me a lot of time and helps avoid double booking .
I can designate who can make reservations and who can't.
The only thing I would change is the TIME , having it next to the date makes it easy to overlook and it 's rarely adjusted by the individual making the reservation .
If the time had its own fields , I would give it a full 5 stars .
Another thing that would be helpful is if the vehicle is already reserved for that day and time , do not show it as an option in the drop down menu .
People get frustrated selecting a vehicle and getting a message saying it 's already reserved and still having it as an option .
Great service !
I was concern to do the job by an online translation provider .
Rev does provide the most professional service and in a speed of light .
I will use it again .
I ordered two harmonick balance repair sleeves , They are very lite weight , and small , don , t understand why i get one UPS and the day after got the other in regular mail . That would have put me a day late finishing my job i had to do , So i just went to near by Napa parts and purchased another one . Anyway the two sleeves i purchased should have been in same package .
Spot on !
Great service , thank you .
Outstanding service !
they were very helpful , and delivery was extremely quick .
I would recommend Reidys to anyone .
easy , fast and hassle free
It was easy and fast to apply . instant approval response , with finds available the next day . website answered all my questions . by far the best cash advance company I've used .
For a great cure .
Super quick and great deals .
Quick and Easy - Resonably Priced
B&H has one of the best sites I have found for shopping .
The search capability is great getting me to what I'm looking for quickly and easily .
Checkout is equally quick and easy .
A great place to shop .
First Class seller !
My dealing with West Coast Shaving have been great .
They ship fast and communicate well .
I haven't had any problems of any kind .
Don't think I will use this site again .
While I believe the end result was good , I wouldn't know for sure .
Even though I was sent notification that it was sent right away , it has still not arrived at it 's intended destination .
It has been 10 days today .
Also , the site kept kicking me out and not saving any of my work .
I had to recreate the card 4 times !!!!
It even kicked me out of this review once !
The site definitely needs MORE WORK !!!
But , the idea is good .
If it ever gets to my sister , I think she will love it .
great service and good price
Royal mail is far too expensive , interparcel has an excellent service .
Good price , fast !
Will do business again and again
Always good service Always good price
I Placed an order in Nov 2012 ... Nov 11th I received an email stating my order had shipped .
Today is Jan 17th 2013 and i am still waiting for my delivery .
i have sent numerous emails , faxes and unanswered phone calls .
This company frustrates me to no end !
Simply AMAZING and FAST
everything was as described and even better .
Got a good price for my Iphone 4 . got my money so quick .
NEVER AGAIN !
I place my first order on Sunday , 07/08/2012 .
Today is Wednesday , 07/11/2012 .
Only now do they decide to ship my order out to me !
The time it will take to ship my order via ' SmartPost ' still remains to be seen so , this is still an undecided total failure to me .
All in all , a very dissatisfactory transaction for me .
I suppose that I've been completely spoiled by ' Amazon Prime 's ' efficient shipping methods .
' Nuff said .
No More Allergies Or G . E . R . D . ~
*This review is in reference to the " Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain-Free Salmon Recipe Natural Revolutionary Diet ", which I found on your website 2 months ago for the low price of $ 49.99 each , w/free s + h . I also received the added incentive of $ 15.00 off the order when I signed up for the ' Auto-Ship ' program .
Not only did my first order arrive in lightning-speed time , ( less than 48 hours from when the order was placed) , it also boasts of a generous ' Expiration Date ' of over 1 year 's time , but I paid far less per bag than even Amazon . com has ever offered to me !
Looks like you'll have a loyal customer for some time to come .
Thanks MrChewy . com !
Sincerely , JJ2007
" When I met my last rescue pet , Dixie , approximately 8.5 years ago , she was a real mess -- both externally and internally .
She exhibited a nervous condition ( G . E . R . D .
) that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions ; that is to say , that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up !
She was painfully emaciated , skeletal almost , and her blood-work was all over the place .
So , after a round of IV fluids and 2 small bags of the ' Science Diet ' chow , Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home .
The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition ; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the ' Science Diet ' regimen--it 's too full of ingredients which I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs .
Lo ' and behold , I stumbled upon the " Blue Buffalo Wilderness " formula for dogs .
It seemed like a good fit , due to all of the proper ratios ( protein/fat ) and is totally " GRAIN-FREE ".
The rest , as they say , is history .... 8.5 years later , Dixie now weighs in at approximately 24 loving , happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend .
I can trust MyBariatricPantry . com for all my nutrtional needs !
I have ordered from you many times & have been satisfied with everything I've ordered .
The delivery has been on time & satisfactory .
I will continue to be a friend of My Bariatric Pantry
This is a great company .
I had no problems what so ever when placing my order .
And their e-mails were to the point and constant the whole way through .
I would recommend this company to anyone .
Professional , clear , reassuring .
A pleasure to deal with .
I placed my order on the 4th of July and it arrived on the 10th of July all the way to Melbourne Australia .
I am most impressed with this company .
I have had dealings with this company in the past and will continue do so into the future .
Well done CountryAttire . com !
Probably the best fitting glasses I've ever had
My new glasses are co for table to wear , fit perfectly and were a fraction of the price in high street shops
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ALL TIME . SEEMS LIKE AMATEUR BUSINESS OWNERS .
Ami has the WORST customer service .
Returning /exchanging item is the biggest hassle of all time .
They do not even let you receive a refund .
Only store credit that does not even deduct right away at check out .
HORRIBLE getting through their phone system .
U will never get through so don't bother .
They also try to rip you off by not even showing the price of the item on your order sheet .
Doesn't even show you how much you paid for anything on the invoice they ship .
Clothing quality is very cheap and poor .
They photoshop too much so you can't even tell what kind of material the item is .
They don't even state what size model is wearing .
great prices , wide choice & easy to use
I always use Interparcel for any large (> 2Kg ) parcels for eBay & household items .
They offer the most competitive prices with household named courier companes & their service is easy to use ...
smooth transaction & delivery ...
the best priced Reflex One Stop Extreme on the market at the time & the transaction was smooth & delivery prompt ...
Always a pleasure shopping with you guys
Always fast delivery , lots of items to choose from , and friendly customer service
Shipped product on time & what I needed .
Great service & price .
Very good site
Very good site and communications
Very pleasureful on-line experience

Watch out for the added fees
Auto Europe nearly always has the best rate on rental cars , but you definitely have to watch out for the added fees charged by the actual rental car company themselves as they can add up to more than the actual rental charge .
The fees include surcharge for pick up at airport or train station , licensing fees , etc .
Other companies include these fees in the price , so it can be difficult to make an honest comparison .
To be fair , AutoEurope does state on the voucher ( after you've completed the transaction ) an approximation of these charges .
Excellant , professional service
Looked florists up in Greenville , SC found Avas Flowers , called them to ordered flowers for an aunt that was in a rehab center , they were very helpful in choosing an arrangement .
The flowers were delivered as promised on time .
I would recommend them to anyone !
No issues , product arrived promptly
No issues , product arrived promptly and well wrapped .
Good product , swiftly delivered , no fuss
Good product , swiftly delivered , no fuss .
Good quality on-line information .
Your service makes a complicated credit report easy to understand .
I really appreciate the alerts I receive , and also the simplicity of reading and understanding the credit report and scoring systems .
I am happy I enrolled , and will encourage my friends and family to do the same .
Very happy - but could have been better informed about delivery
Very happy with the product , great price , good website .
Only gripe is that although I was able to choose my delivery date when ordering , I never got confirmation of this .
I got an email confirming my order but it didn't confirm anywhere the date I had selected , and also no indication of approximate time .
On the day itself I didn't get an indication of when it would arrive - a text or call would have been useful - but it arrived nice and early anyway so I wasn't waiting all day for it .
Otherwise I was very happy and they were thorough in other areas - during the order process specific information about parking , how many floors above ground you are etc .
are asked to make sure no problems on the day .
Professional company , good value and plenty of delivery options
I've used Joker 's Masquerade a few times over the years when I've needed a costume , and always been very satisfied .
Products are a bit pricey but they have a very good selection , and their customer service is outstanding - plenty of delivery options , stock guarantees , track & trace , clear indications of deadlines .
They've got a decent blog , and even a webcam service to watch the warehouse workers and sales staff !
Great price , instant delivery .
Bought some Xbox 360 points for an excellent price , the code to redeem them was sent to my email account within minutes .
Fantastic service .
I have had a Great Experience with Plaquemaker !
I would recommend to everyone who is interested !
Prompt service !
Very easy to use and friendly staff as well
SpareFoot was very helpful in searching for a storage unit during our move .
There was a lot of information available and was easy to search by many different criteria to find the right spot .
We wanted a climate controlled unit on the first floor of a facility and those were among the options SpareFoot listed to help narrow our search .
Lots of listings throughout the area .
Using this site saved a lot of time from looking up individual units or calling around which probably saved us money .
Speaking of saving , they have deals with moving trucks etc to help with that part of the move too .
I called the number to confirm everything I saw on the site and the staff was very helpful .
Definitely recommend using this site .
prompt and efficient
This company is very good .
With all the things we have on our minds today , it 's wonderful not to worry about running out of dog food .
After you select your shipping arrangements , you're done .
The dog food comes on time and is left at your door .
How great is this .
I was sent a part that did not work .
I did receive my desired part in a trimely manner , but when I tested it out , I discovered that it did not work .
And what made matters worse , I had to pay postage to send it back
to get my money back .
The partsgeek should have payed my return postage but they did not .
They put on a bad show for me .
PRICE , DELIVERING SERVICE , MODERN INVENTORY , CHECKOUT , CONDITION OF THE MERCHANDISE , EXCELLENT !!!
Great shopping experience
I found VisionDirect to be the most comprehensive site about listing details of their products and the most reasoanble when it came to postage .
And of course their prices were very reasoanble compare to what I was looking at paying instore .
This was my first purchase , and hopefully not my last .
I would recommend this site to a would-be buyer .
Love the clothes , true to size and fit perfectly
High-quality product at a great price .
Would recommend to others !
With so many promotional products companies to choose from in the marketplace , iPromo delivered with fast turn-around of a quality product at a great price .
Extremely Professional , Fast , and Best Prices
From first contact , our salesman , Anthony , delivered high-quality and professional service and follow-up .
We were able to get the best price available on our USB selection - AND print on both sides at no extra charge .
Quick production , high quality , fast shipping AND a U.S. based company !!
We would highly recommend Flashbay to others !
great product , great service
Bought some rope lights at a great price , great product and they were delivered very quickly .
The Long Term Parking operation at Newark airport is run very well , is reasonably priced and efficient .
The Long Term Parking operation at Newark airport is very reasonably priced , well managed and efficient .
I makes parking at the airport a pleasant operation .
When we returned from our flight , the shuttle for the parking quickly picked is up and drove us to our car which was already to go .
I would definitely use Long Term Parking again when I must travel from the airport for a few days .
Prompt free delivery , Item was a bargain price .
Easy website to navigate , great prices , clear stock levels .
Delivery was quick & free !
Can't really fault it .
Thanks Taunton Leisure !
The hardest kit , from the BEST on the web !
Have used many times & they never fail to amaze .
Super quick delivery & the best service of any internet supplier .
These guys are great !
I have only purchased products from this store a couple of times , but all of them have gone very smoothly .
The prices are great ( It 's video games I'm purchasing BTW) .
I even made my first pre-order ever and it went great .
I can only blame the postal service in my area for it being one day late .
I think everyone should try to purchase from Spelbutiken . se at least ONCE if they are considering to get a new game , or old one ( retrospelbutiken . se) .
Recommended site .
true it does what it says on the site quick and cheap
quick to arrive pleased with the whole experience would recommend it to anyone
will be using allbeauty again
Quick delivery fantastic product
The blinds arrived very quickely within 5 days and that included a weekend
I didn't expect the blinds to be up to much as they were so cheap and was really pleased when I opened them they were fantastic quality , I'm really thrilled .
Fantastic quick delivery
Easy to use website and came next day very pleased and will defiantly be using them again
Thank you rachel
Priceline is great for bidding for hotel rooms and getting great value for amazing price .
To get top quality hotels at amazing prices , you should bid at Priceline .
I had a business trip in Fresno , Ca ., and wanted to stay at the best hotel in town .
The top star rating was 3 1/2 stars .
I checked many different websites , and the Radisson had a lowest published price of $ 108.00 per night .
I bid for a 3 1/2 star hotel at Priceline for $ 65.00 , and got that price at the Radisson .
Priceline 's star rating system is very accurate , and I have used it on a number of occasions .
With fewer empty flights and heavy air bookings , bidding on a flight is not as productive as it once was .
Bidding on a hotel room , however , provides excellent results .
Exactly what I was expecting - and fast !
I love these !
Planning to use them on favor jars for my wedding , and the designs offered were great .
Plus , I got these so quickly !
Still waiting on the jars !
( from a different site )
holy sheep shirt
Great store !
I like to shop clothes off Nygard online as they have a great collection at very attractive prices , the only thing I'd like to see is reviews , don't just display the ratings but lets others write down what they think about items they buy from your site .
No customer service
Typo on address would not resend , have to reorder .
Excellent price , no hassle , no surprise .
That 's how I like it !
The booking was there when we arrived , the car could have been cleaner but nothing went wrong with it and the returning it was fast and easy .
I will definitely use their services again if I go back to Europe .
Reliable people , hidden costs
I used Auto Europe twice within a few weeks .
I rented a car for Central Europe for 10 days and then the UK for 10 days .
Both times I dealt with friendly people on the phone that did a great job searching for good rates .
Were very responsive with my questions and a change that I made .
However , when I actually got my car , there were a lot of extra charges that were in tiny print on the form .
One charge even says " additional fees " but with no cost next to it .
It ended up being at least $100 more for each rental when I picked up which was very frustrating .
If I use them again , I'll make sure to ask very specific questions .
If everything is not perfect , they deal with it immediately !
The Dallas JPMorgan International Plaza location is the perfect location for my International Tax Law business .
And the people managing the facility are the kind of people that I have always tried to hire to represent me .
You will not find this level of professional relationship anywhere else in the business world .
excellent service and great low prices !
Great price Great deal
i found that they do price match and beat i liked ordering with this company .
i also just have to add check your order i received everything i paid for but not most of the free stuff .
i didnt complain cause its all ok but i placed another order and this time i want all the free stuff hope i get it !
Best vacation planner !
We used Tripadvisor for the first time to plan a very special trip to Italy .
I relied on the reviews and ratings to choose hotels that would be special without breaking the bank .
I couldn't have been more pleased with the results .
We stayed at places that ranged from good to perfect and all within a set budget .
It is hard work sorting out all of the comments by different reviewers , but once you figure out who is honest and who has an axe to grind , you can make informed decisions and rely on the ratings .
A great service that I use all the time now .
A great and convenient service
Great service with great prices for the food we use !
The only minor complaint we have is that the shipping carton is usually mangled and ripped by the time it gets to our door , so it can be hard to lift into the house because you can't grip it without it ripping more .
A minor issue and one that does not keep us from coming back time and again .
quality quick service
5 Paws up !
I have been buying from VetRxDirect for quite some time now , they have always been speedy in processing my orders !
Also , you can tell they are very caring when it comes to animals .
Thanks VetRx !!!
excellent product exactly what I needed .
I have been looking for vinal numbers for my large car locally with no/little sucess .
Went to my faithful computer and found DIY , this is a great product !
Went on wwith no problems and look great .
I wiil use them again when I need something like this again .
Thank You ------------ John Sarver
My orders never took long to arrive , I was very pleased with the prompt and quick service .
Since logging into the network Boohoo , I've being totally amazed at the fantastic styles and trends they have , the prices are friendly and I found them quiet affordable , plus you can also find shoes to match the outfit you buy , have a look
NOT A UK based company !
Terrible service .. cheap glasses
This company is in HONG KONG , although they advertise themselves as UK based .
If you want slightly cheaper glasses but are willing to 1 ) wait for weeks until they arrive 2 ) take the risk of them coming back broken 3 ) wait weeks until you get refunded ; then go for this company .
I ordered prescription glasses , which were cheaper than other website and I was excited .
After nearly two weeks , I heard back from them saying that the order will be delayed .
And after another week , the glasses finally came in a HONG KONG DHL pacakage to my surprise ( I had thought they were in UK , and would ship in a few days , not a few weeks ! ) .
Worst of all , the lenses came broken !
After having paid to return the product , and a week later they send saying the glasses are perfectly fine ( as if I enjoy wasting my time and money ! ) .
After confirmation I was not crazy , they promised to reship another new fixed pair .
However , another two weeks elapsed with nothing , nor any word from them .
Being frustrated with the already two months delay to actually have my glasses , I had to resend them to ask about the status of my order , only to find out that they still had not received it and the order will take a few more days to arrive to ' them ' ( meaning a few more weeks until it actually reaches me) .
Being frustrated I asked to cancel my order altogether and be refunded , in which case they agreed and said the refund should be done in my bank within a few days .
Again , another ten days elapsed and nothing , and when I sent them back they sent me one email saying ' sorry i forgot to cancel your order ' followed by a corrected email saying ' they have canceled but not done the refund yet'.
Until now ( over two weeks of my cancellation ) and I have not seen my refund ( although they sent me a receipt of refund) .
I could sense this company is NOT honest about 1 ) WHO they are 2 ) how long things really take to arrive .
If they just tell customers in advance where they are , it would set the expectations straight about when things will be arriving , and people would have then a choice to take the risk of buying something that is overseas ( with the chances of it coming broken , or taking weeks before arrival) , knowing that it is cheaper .
But they would have an informed choice !
Great service !
Received through the US Postal Service within days of my order just as expected , thanks .
Many thanks to Eddie and the boys at GAK .
First rate and friendly service , have now got my number one site to check out any future purchases .
It made an exciting purchase even better .
Rock on !
My first stop for cycling stuff
good value for money massive choice quick free postage , and haribo as well what more could you want !!!!
The send a photo feature is brilliant
I did have to chase foe details but other than that quick and efficient , If only I could get the part to work ( purely down to me ) it would be great .
The best place for car parts
Part came very quick was easy to install
HotToner Cannon Inks
I have not tested the product yet , the Cannon inks I purchased were to replace stock used .
I was however very impressed with the price and the speed of service ; I ordered at 3pm and the goods were delivered the next day .
Received 1 used item
I received 1 used bag of clips .
It was pretty obvious .
I guess you realize that I probably wouldn't put through the effort to call and send them back ... hassle .
It 's disappointing .
Saved by this UK eFlorist !
I left it a little late to organize a gift to be delivered at the weekend in the UK ( I live in the US ) - my options this side of the pond would only arrange delivery after the weekend .
Thankfully , this website popped up and saved my bacon and made my Mum happy on her birthday !
Everything fell into place and Mum loved the Treats Gift Basket .
By the time I spoke to her , Mum and Dad had already got into the wine - well , it IS Wine O'clock somewhere , right ?
excellent customer service
The representative i spoke with understood my needs immediately and suggested the best and least expensive storage company .
Overall a good experience
Plus points - Website is great and easy to navigate , customer service ( when you get to speak to someone ) is excellent and on line contact is pretty good too in terms of follow up .
Delivery service DPD are excellent .
Negative points - the delivery process seems very disorganised .
Some things are VERY delayed in delivery or indeed do not arrive at all ( not a DPD problem if they are not receiving the goods ) I have cancelled a number of items because I was fed up with waiting for them and then noticed the site was running the same products again ( that did not make any sense )
Returns are also delayed in terms of processing - an email would be useful to say the returned goods have been received and then when the credit has been applied to the account .
When I look at my account it states when some refunds have been applied but not always so I am forever having to follow things up with PayPal or my credit card to see the activity .
There doesn't appear to be a consistent process that applies to all things .
Sometimes the description of products is not very comprehensive and not enough pictures ( small issue )
Quick delivery .
Well packaged .
Well priced .
Price is right , service is great .
Price is right and the service is great .
Great Company Reps ... Reps Great Company Prodcuts
Loved working with this company and in particular , their service rep . Jessie Kate .
Would highly recommend this company and their excellent products .
Pure Forula . com is fast and inexpensive with free shipping
I ordered TriSalts .
There was a promo code for 20% off the already low price .
They inclused free shipping and the product arrived in 3 or 4 days .
I would definetly order from them again ,
Always the right parts
Always the right parts at a good price delivered quickly and well packaged
Refunded faulty goods with no quibbles
I bought a pair of MTB shoes from Wiggle .
One shoe started to break after a year so I returned them via Wiggle 's free returns system and they refunded them in full .
Great service - I'll be buying from them again .
This company do what they say - I've used them several times and they come when they say they will and do the job .
The staff are friendly and competent .
I had a problem this time whereby the tyres I purchased weren't in stock so they rang me and offered alternatives .
Once I'd chosen a new tyre , a new fitting date was agreed .
Picked up and dropped off at the airport short-stay car park .
Friendly staff .
As it said on the tin .
Priceline makes it so easy to get an extremely nice hotel room , at an affordable rate !
I never book a hotel room without Priceline !
If you didn't get your room through Priceline , you paid WAY too much !
Good idea in theory but CUSTOMER SERVICE service is lacking .
I liked the idea of having my luggage shipped but when delivery went sideways the customer service MANAGER was robotic in her response .
No empathy and gave me the company line " we are only responsible for delivering luggage from door to door and that is what we did ".
Lets just say damaged luggage and messed up delivery didn't leave me feeling like using this service ever again .
Incredibly fast .
Great service overall :)
My first time buying a game code online really and I am so glad that it was with cjs-cdkeys .
Was delivered seconds after i ordered .
I highly recommend this service .
A Real Deal , Fast !!
Needed new headlights to replace in a Subaru Forester 2002 , placed the order on PartsGeek for Sylvania Headlight bulb , SilverStar Ultra x 2 which was $20 cheaper each !!
than in the local stores , and it arrived on the door step about 3 days later - Ground , for $8 in postage .
Great fast service , and what a deal !!
Put the headlights in , and hubby was stunned , they work so much better !
Good Products , new , and a good deal .
Will definitely recommend PartsGeek to others I know .
My husband , who has been very ill , is enjoying the earphones as I write this .
They arrived quickly , in good condition and are GREAT !
Thanks so much .
lovely curtains - very pleased
Very pleased and impressed with these lovely curtains .
They arrived individually packed and labelled for each room which made them very easy to put them up .
Unfortunately , I miscalculated the measurements and ordered double the width needed .
instead of double the window width I ended up with four times width !
My mistake :(
( My tip : - Triple check your measurements everybody xxx )
I would definately recommend Woodyatt Curtains and would buy from them again ...
Very satisfied , I found the product and in more the delivery was very fast
je recommande votre site dés que j'en ai l'occasion
Best parts and low prices

Website is great and stuff gets to you quickly
Birch gold knows their stuff !
When I was trying to decide which gold company I wanted to invest with , birch gold was a step above the rest .
Some of the salespeople at other companies felt pushy , which I didn't like .
Not with Birch .
Guy was easy to undersatnd and I felt safe knowing that my ira was going to have a little security from inflation .
The process with the trust company went seamlessly .
Since then I've told many friends and family about the excellent service from Birch Gold .
Cant recommend them highly enough .
Disappointing service ...
Book my order for Sprint iphone 5 unlock last December 13 , 2012 , and until now they cannot deliver the service they promised .
I think 3 months of waiting time is already too long , that 's why im crying foul .
I'm still crossing my fingers they can get the job done .
As for now , i am not recommending your service to any one .
The real DEAL !
Have been using Golf18 for over a year now and it has always been easy to use , a good savings compared to other sites or course green fees , and has us playing some courses we might never have tried as it makes them more affordable .
Would recommend it to anyone .
Awesome transaction experience !
Thank you for the fast efficient transaction .
It 's by far , the best service I've recieved from any company .
I've Highly recommended your company to many !
Thank you !
Hassle free , easy way to get rid of old mobiles , really quick payment .
I would use this service again for sure .
Great place to shop .
I have been shopping B&H for several years now .
Prices are great , shipments are always timely .
Best of all , I have noticed significant decreases in their prices which makes this a terrific place to shop .
Have shopped for better prices numerous times and aways come back to B&H Photo-Video .
Petflow delivery was an answer to my prayers !
My vehicle was recently wrecked beyond repair , and I found myself very short on dog food for my senior dog , 13 and the new adult who is 1 .
PetFlow was able to deliver the Senior 9+ Iams ( which I had been unable to find ) and a 33lb bag of Iams Adult for the baby !.
Thank you PetFlow for saving the day !
Lied about parts availability
" Available " on the website is not accurate .
The part I ordered was not in stock , though the website claimed that it was .
Worse , it took over 24 hours to get this notification , and 4 days to get my money returned .
Delivered as promised .
Size and Product was good .
Only questionable thing was they were christmas center pieces and the had apples in them ?
Great company with quick service !
I bought simcity on their website hoping to save a few bucks and after 25 minutes received my origin key !
Great website that sends your key pretty quickly .
Speedy and excellent service .
I looked on the web-site and easily found the part that I needed Payed on-line and recieved the item within the stated time-scale .
Great service and would recommend this site to anyone .
Good , pretty fast service from CA
I would buy from them again
I am happy with the products .
I was happy with the service and the customer support .

adult sex toys for women men gay lesbianSex toys , vibrators , dildos and masturbators from onlineadultsextoy . com
Arrived and work as advertised .
A good product for the price .
No regrets .
Top quality parts , great prices , kept their promises
I searched around , shopped online with the large auto parts stores , and found the same exact parts , brand and part number at huge savings with PartsGeek .
The shipping rates were less than what I would have paid in taxes !
Excited when ordering , satisfied when received the order !
Very prompt delivery !
Was satisfied with the costume order . would recommend to friends .
Impressed with the designs
Wrong size delivered , wont order from them again .
Ordered a pair of medium gloves for a present and was sent a pair of large ones , I wouldn't mind but they had large L 's on them obviously not checked before they were sent .
Not good enough so won't be using them again
Fast shipping and good communication
These guys have good prices and they respond back to you .
Will buy from again .
i love my labels
My labels were easy to order .
The quality is great .
They came really fast .
I will def order again
Outstanding Service and Support
I have been purchasing since 2009 , good prices , fast delivery time and great after sales support .
Good price , shipped fast ,
Everything went very well , but I never got an email confirmation of the purchase .
I guess it could have gotten caught in a spam filter , but I checked all the filter queues and couldn't find it .
They indicated they sent it , I just never found it .
All in all , things went as expected .
I can't really give the 5 stars since I couldn't find the receipt .
But I'd buy from them again if I need something .
Brilliant , so pleased to have discovered this company , can't wait to order from them again !
Being able to get a single refill rather than a pack of 12 for my favourite pen ( no longer made ) was really useful , especially as I wasn't sure if they would fit or not ( which it has )
Found the descriptions of pencil lead incredibly helpful and it has performed above my expectations .
Wish I could do more writing than typing at the moment !
& received a free pen as well , excellent stuff
Very fast service
Wery fast at posting out the parcel to me .
Excellent quality and very quick service
The website was very easy to use with lots of helpful information on how to measure etc .
The curtains arrived very quickly and I am very pleased with the accuracy and quality .
Forward fees are low , withdrawl fees are a bit high .
If you need to vault 50-100k of bullion , and don't mind only getting cash in return - these guys are great - but withdrawl fees are a bit high , and the minimum monthly fees are a little prohibitive to smaller portfolios .
That said , they do seem to care about the experience of their users , and after interacting with their customer service over some commission issues , I feel I should raise my original rating
As a real Scotsman in Belgium , it feel as a little bit home .
It feels very good to help the beautiful nature in the home country
Excellent customer service
Eric Nelson has given me superior service and is very responsive .
He is a top notch sales person and customer service rep .
Unbelievably good deals coupled with a vast collection .
The discounts and offers that run daily add excellent opportunities to try new products before risking larger purchases .
Delivery is fast and prompt .
Not enough positive words for this wonderful website !!
ordered sent delivered no worries
Easy to use the website and easy to order and fast delivery .
Very happy with everything
Problems were minimal
We were quite happy with Viator 's offerings .
The only issues we had were that because we were staying in an apartment through AirBnB it meant that we actually had to travel to get to Viator 's limited pickup zones , so basically any savings we made going via AirBnB were negated by the taxi ride to the pickup zones .
Also , one of the bus trips were a bit clunky , we had to get off and wait for a second mini bus to get to San Diego .
The bus took a lot longer than expected , but the driver was great and even made the effort to locate our hostel .
These were just a couple of things of note , but overall it was a great service which I hope to use once again on my upcoming trips .
Quick , reliable , secure , easy !
I'd really like you to use Mazuma - you won't believe how fast they are !
The process is so swift , you bearly have time to let the battery cool in your old mobile before it is in a bag and with Mazuma and then you are paid !
Items as described and shipped promptly with care .
First time ordering .
Painless , items showed up in a few days and was pleased with quality of items .
Constructive feedback ... the small 5 pack of Razor Blades are just thrown in among the packing pellets and can be quite hard to find .
Maybe put them in a small envelope or tape them to the invoice ?
Just an idea ... I had to dig around for several minutes to find them .... Thanks
Partsgeek . com I belive is one of the best parts distributers out there .
I will be back for all my parts needs .
so far-so good
the price was fine .
the service was fine ( arrived in a few days) .
but i haven't used the ink yet so i don't know anything about it .
Not worth it
Got a coupon for a light weight blanket that was personalized .
It is hardly a blanket , it is made of a very thin piece of material .
Not what I expected unfortunately .
The service was good , product was bad .
My labels are perfect and it was so easy !
I ordered ice cream serving cup labels for my daughter 's wedding .
We could not be more pleased with the quality of the labels and the reasonable price .
We had a terrific variety of options for style , size and color and our order was expertly handled .
I am very impressed with My Own Labels and definitely recommend them .
Great but slow shipping
I love the brand and the products however as i'm international its very slow shipping
Convenient cheap and many options
In 2013 , I used globalairport parking for booking my IAD airport parking .
I chose Holiday Inn .
Shuttle service was convenient .
I had to park the car at the back side spacious lot .
Only thing to note is you should have extra time in hand to go to front desk , park and take the luggage back to shuttle .
Not like at BWI , just drop the car and board the shuttle .
I think self parking near airport is expensive , equally time consuming so global airport parking is better .
This year also I have reserved at globalairport parking .
I got around total $2 more discount .
I am going for Best Western this time .
shipment was fast , delivery was slow
iam pleased to have seen a fast shipment to the usa .
but its been over a week and I have not received my order .
really blows .
im hoping the product is worth all this wait " /
Very easy to access parts needed .
Great web site .
Good information .
Easy to access parts list .
Good follow up with shipping information .
I will use them again .
Thank you .
Love the quick service !
Thank you for the many years of fulfilling my orders .
I am very grateful for the savings and shipping .
MAZUMA IS FROM AN OTHER PLANET
l tell you what my friend , MAZUMA is a really really top company , after over 30 years l have ben in Australia this is the first time ever
l deal with a company who provider TOP TOP service , fast fast response and best best price , l sold them 5 mobil phone some of them not in top condition , if I had sold them privately I would not have gained much .
To all the MAZUMA staff : THANKS TO ALL OF YOU
WOW An Amazing Transaction
This is the first time that I have dealt with Mazuma - WOW , an Amazing transcation from start to finish .
Smooth , simple , informed all the way , received payment on the same day as I received the payment email !!
Will be dealing with Mazuma again and again
Could not have been easier !
Got some decent money for my old phones and they made it very simple .
Couldn't be happier !
Don't ever buy at this site .
They're taking YEARS to deliver the key .
They have no live chat , support is taking days to answer the ticket .
Never buy at this site .
Ace service and delivery
Specific requirements were in the system , available , and delivered promptly with the racquet strung and ready to use .
What else could one ask for .
No hassle no delays , no excuses .
sounds like a " good deal "
I think i will try Amazon .
the other reviews were mostly good , and the prices seem very reasonable .
I fill out application online , received approval in 5 minutes .
Excellent service and rapid delivery
I was truly impressed by the price of the Vamo kit it was exactly as described !
I was not happy with the tank that came with the kit due to the air hole being on the 510 screw thread .
I was extremely impressed by the delivery time as I ordered my vamo Friday morning and it arrived Saturday morning .
I would definitely recommend Vapertrain to friends and other ecig users !
the new cut offs for cancellations of hotels is really unfortunate ,.
Been a customer of Travelocity for yrs .
The new 2 day cancellation rule is slightly a downer .
Great customer service , a little pricey on the percentage rate but we are building credit here .
They really went out of their way to make buying a car easy and hassle free .
Very friendly staff and easy to talk to in a friend kind of way !
Easy and wonderful !
I have found the best rooms at such an affordable price !!
Great deals on vacations !
Quick and easy to use !!
Love it !
Excellent item , value for money , swift delivery

CityLink delivered next working day , very pleased .
Excellence in quality of service and products
This site has a remarkable excellence in quality of service and products , don't hesitate , buy to them
very efficient , really quick turn around and always have what you are looking for !
This company are really effiecient , shipment always arrives earlier than anticipated .
they will always make sure you get your coupon or discount at checkout .
Always have what you are looking for .
They never let me down
I find Comms Express to have quality products at the right price and prompt delivery as standard .
Moreover they never let me down when I request and pay for a specific delivery arrangement .
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER
I did a search for the part number I wanted and expected it to be the number that came up first , but of course , it wasn't.
I , however , selected the first item and added to the cart and checked out .
I entered the part number again because I forgot to get pricing only to find out that I entered the wrong item .
I immediately tried to contact customer service , but the phone number tells you that you have to submit an online support ticket and someone will get back to you in 1-2 business days ( after of course , the material has shipped ) - still , I submitted a support ticket .
I had another issue to discuss with them and tried to enter another support ticket , only to find out you can only have 1 open at a time .
Give me a freakin ' customer service rep I can talk to on the phone .
This is the most ridiculous set up I've ever seen and if there is any way possible , I will not use them again .
Never less than perfect
I'm always impressed with Yesstyle ; besides having the cutest clothes , they have fast service and very reasonable shipping when you think about the fact that it comes from another continent .
I've never had any issues with shipping or products and I'm always excited to see a package from them in my mailbox :)
your service is amazing ... thanks a lot ...
your service is amazing ... thanks a lot ...
I've ordered from yesstyle before and I am very pleased with them !
Easy to use system that make 's life easier when you are hungry
Delivery . com is easy to use .
Easy to find restaurants that delivery , including all the details ( time , delivery fee , menu , etc . ) .
Also can pay with credit card .
Great thing is the constant deals that apply ($8 off , 15% off , laundry etc . ) .
Makes me use it even more .
Trustworthy , Fast shipping
BH Photo is trustworthy and ships fast .
Excellent products and perfect service
The Whiskey Exchange is an excellent place to sample a variety of spirits from around the world , at a reasonable price .
The website is clear and easy to use , customer contact is brilliant , packages arrive quickly , well within their estimates , and well packaged .
Even better than I had hoped for .
Recommended to change , I did , and even better than I had hoped for .
will order again
Super fast shipping !
I got my items in 5 business days I was so excited I got them in time before the party .
I love everything it does NOT feel cheap like some of the reviews said the woman on the phone answered very fast and was very polite and answered all my questions everything was as pictured and was true to size .
I love this site and I will be ordering more .
I think I found my new favorite store .
Thanks AMI :)
Web interface is fine for ordering and they are always quick to despatch .
If they sell it - buy it from them !
Excellent service .
Same-day shipping .
No nonsense emails telling me all I need to know .
Website quirky but useable .
Cartridge depleted alert
I just received my ink cartridges .. two black and one color in a set .
Installed the first black cartridge this morning and got an immediate alert on my computer that the cartridge was depleted .
When I checked the ink level it shows 10% .
Terribly frustrated .
Not sure if I will trust them with another order .
Very good service and product received
Would definitely recommend the service
prompt and efficient
Smooth process .
Great way to visit London !
I strongly recommend using the Big Bus to visit London .
No reservations but two suggestions : continue to run buses later than 19h ( and inform the latest pass in every stop ) and offer more than two days option , since it is very interesting to use the big bus to visit a portion of the city a day ...
Excellent and fast !
I would highly recommend medisave .
Several confirmation emails and tracking numbers .
Great follow up .
Fast delivery .
Very satisfied .
Easy to use and find textbooks for cheap !
Found a textbook for one of my classes on this website at half the cost my school and other resellers had it for .
Overall , easy and pleasant experience .
Would buy from again !

Making the reservation was very easy and fast .
Ordering was very easy and fast delivery .
Looking up the filter I needed was so easy and the rest was easy too .
The delivery time was very fast as well .
Would have been better if the part fit .
I ordered a replacement mirror for the passenger side door .
It did not fit .
I don't know yet if I got the wrong one .
Hopefully , I can send it back and get the right one .
Highly recommend speedy delivery perfect items great quality
I would recommend this store .
Great value for money and very speedy delivery with great communication .
Had to phone the store as was having a problem with paying on the website customer service lady was helpful and spoke with it however when I asked if I could phone order I was told that there too much if a back log to order ???
But hey Ho .
Still very satisfied and very happy with being given a 1 hour delivery slot by dpd deliveries
Fast Shipping .
Supplement warehouse has fast shipping and great prices .
This is my second order from them .
Would recommend them to everyone .
This company pays great attention to detail .
I've had a lot of things printed online , and my biggest gripe is that companies will often send me prints that have not been centered .
Not so with MY OWN LABELS .
I ordered labels for a batch of hard cider I had brewed .
The design would have suffered if it was a bit off center .
To my great joy , it was all perfectly aligned .
Thanks a million !
Good quality products but cheap as chips
I can't say anything bad about Dolphin cause they have never let me down .
They are friendly , know their stuff and get your gear out to you rapid .
Best of all they do pretty much everything you need for a ridiculously low price .
I wouldn't go anywhere else to be honest .
Top notch !
Good price and fast response time .
The prices are good and I recieved a call from the storage company quickly .
Superb service !!
5 stars all the way
I've been ordering my contact lenses through Lenstore for a while now the service and speed of delivery is excellent .
Wouldn't buy anywhere else now .

Fast and easy .
no problem at all .
while returning to parking lot , my car was ready in front of the exit gate with A/C on .
great service .
the is a wonderful website .
I ordered a kohls watch from jacob time .
Saved 200 off msrp .
Shipped in one day .
Cant get much better than that .
CLUTTER FREE JUNK REMOVAL SERVICE IS THE BEST !!!
I went through the tedious task of trying to find a company that would remove my 11 year old carpet and also some old furniture .
All the places I called either didn't return my call or would only give me a phone estimate and didn't want to come and see the job in person .
This was until I was lucky enough to come across Clutter Free Junk Removal Service and Clean .
From the first time I called I was able to reach the owner Raul who asked me questions and provided an estimate over the phone .
He also cut the price down by giving me a 15% discount !
I asked if he could stop by and he immediately said yes and was able to accommodate coming on the weekend since I work .
He came in looked around and quoted me the same price that he had over the phone .
Immediately after we scheduled the appointment the following weekend .
The day of the work went so smoothly .
His team of experts were able to remove everything very quickly .
They were extremely professional and left everything clean .
I recommend Raul and his team of experts to anyone looking for excellent service at a reasonable price .
They are a company that truly delivers !
Great and quick customer service !!
Ordering is easy and fast .
There are no hassles whatsoever .
Never a problem !
Goldstar has arguably been the most dependable site I've used to date .
The only issue I've communicated a concern about was the fees that are charged which occasionally reflect a larger percentage of the price than I believe it should .
Horrible company , customer support , and worst experience .
I have had issues rebooking my flight , actually being able to speak with someone , and so far have still not gotten it fixed after being transferred to several people .
I will never purchase anything through them ever again .
The only way this is being resolved is by United which has had wonderful support .
I would advise to not support Priceline .
Ink does not work ...
Though I received the ink in a very timely manner , the ink was not comparable with the Epson ink cartridges for my printer .
The website said it would work , but it hasn't.
I'm very disappointed .
Great Product and fast shipping !
Ordered some parts for my truck for maintenance and cosmetic purposes and was fully satisfied with the product quality and packaging .
Will do business again !
Best customer service ever !
Great products .
If you encounter any problems , they always answer in few hours .
Good customer treatment .
I really dont have anything negative to say .
Great customer service !
I was booking online , & it kept declining my card for no apparent reason .
So I called customer service , & the lady that helped me was very friendly & professional .
She ran my card on their end , & it was approved .
She re-read my reservation & thanked me .
No hassles .
Very easy process !
Thanks again !
I can't wait to stay in that gorgeous hotel in Daytona !
Great prices and customer service !
I have made several purchases now , prices are good , service has been great !
I would recommend this service to anyone needing a rushed passport .
My case manager , Alex Valdez , made this process so easy for me , I am amazed at the results .
I needed a passport quickly for a planned trip to China .
My passport expired about a year ago , and it has been a while since going thur the process .
I chose RushMyPassport . com as the title and website indicated that this should solve my needs .
It definitely exceeded my expectations .
I submitted my initial request , and early the next day ( even on a Saturday) , a case manager , Alex Valdez , called me to walk me thru the process .
By the time I got off the phone , I had all the information in my inbox ready for me to fill out and sign where indicated .
The helpfullness of Mr . Valdez alleviated any concerns I had to meet my deadlines .
When my formal application was sent on Monday to RMP . com , I had a new passport in my hands 3 days later , even earlier then I expected .
If you need a passport quick , I would recommend this service .
You only typically do this once every 10 years , so I understand how important it is to rely on people who have gone thru the experience to give feedback to help others .
Thank you .
B&H is an honest and reliable company with an easy to use web site .
Every time I place an order with B&H , I'm proud to be supporting the company .
The range of products they carry is excellent , the prices are always competitive and customer service is second to none .
I've placed countless orders with them so far and I plan to keep using them for a long , long time !
OUTSTANDING SOURCE of STANDARD PROCESS formulas
I have not found a more complete source for Standard Process products .
Rapid shipping .
Prices are great too .
Parts + Geek = Win
Great service and amazingly fast delivery of my BMW radiator fan shroud .
Will definitely hit you up next time !
Super quality with great options .
The application is very simple to use with loads of options to make your book stand out .
The option to have one picture over two pages is also great and makes the book even easier to look at .
Definitely deserves *****
very happy with your produce and service
Happy with your service
I ordered two 3 kg bags of pro plan on line it was avaiIable so i went ahead and ordered them , the following day i received an email to say my order was dispatched over a week later it still had not arrived so i phoned you to ask where it was , you told me it hadn't been dispatched you was waiting for one of my orders to come in to stock .
I feel that this should be explained when i was putting my order in , then i would have the choice to wait or get it from somewhere else .
I had to go out and buy a bag as i had ran out , it was for my puppy and i couldn't wait any longer then the day after i purchased a bag of pro plan one of the bags that i ordered from you arrived but i had to wait another 3 days for the other one .
You should let your customers know what you have in stock when they make their order .
Great selection , great website , great prices .
I use Bolt Depot as a go to for all my hard to find nuts , bolts , and rivet needs .
Website is user friendly , prices are great , and they always have what I need in stock .
Recommend this to all friends and co-workers .
Brilliant service , no problems what so ever , would recommend .
Received order within 48 hours as promised , the swing went together very well , the grandchildren delighted with it , will get a lot of use .
So pleased ordered another one for them to have at home .
Brilliant service , although the delivery van broke down on its way to us they still arrived within the time .
Good Experience , easy , quick , and very reliable .
Ordering very straight forward , received confirmation of order directly and e/mails giving information of dates and times of arrival .
Order arrived when stated .
Very good service .
Thank you .
the price and service given by boilerjuice is far better and cheaper than any others i have tried
will definatly use again and have used them for several years now
I paid on the phone and had a chat with the guy about the pens I was buying - he was really nice , with good advice and knowledge about the product .
And my pens arrived next day !
YAY CULT PENS !
Great price and fast enough shipping .
Great Price and Fast Enough Shipping .
Good price , and delivery at an unbelievable speed .
I ordered on line at midday one day and correct order was being delivered at 9am the next .
Perhaps not spectacular for those in Melbourne or Sydney but those of us living outside of Canberra don't expect that kind of service !
The service is second to none
I have used Simply Scuba on many occasions & found them to be both extremely efficient & professional .
Their price comparison does what it says & more .
good and quickly
good stuff and very quickly service !
Norm is trustworthy & phenomenal
The store manager , Norm , is the main reason I do Business in Walpole .
I have sent many customers his way .
He is not pushy , but makes sure you fully understand the reasoning behind his suggestions .
I did have an issue with the way my car was treated and given back to me , but Norm stepped right up .
He understood what I was talking about and took pictures to address the situation , he made me feel like a valued customer .
I did tell him he was the Major reason I do and send business to the Walpole store .
Extremely helpful and easy to use
You should definitely look at using the site , its quick , easy to use and delivery was hassle free .
The best part was the non intrusion in to any circumstances .
Just straight forward and reliable
Deliveries are accurate , timely and packaged well
Definitely worth looking at , the site is easy to navigate and selections can be managed with ease .
Very fast shipping and very happy with the tags .
always a neat response
ink and lead both arrived without the need to think about delayed deliveries
Horrible condition of the product and very slow delivery
The seller didn't match the price as they promote on their website and the product was delivered in 3 days , not on the next day as they ' guranteed', it seems every promice on the website is folse .
When my item finaly arrived it was in horrible condition as second hand .
I would never ever shop with them again .
Awesome service .
Great prices and very fast delivery .
Great products as well .
Great friendly service .
Exceeded my expectations .
Superb in every way
I can't fault any aspect of Best Heating .
I have ordered 2 radiators now both 2 column types and they are great .
They look really lovely in my more traditional house .
Ordering on line was so easy and the delivery was perfect .
My radiators arrived within 2 days , well packaged & the kind delivery man even walked them all the way down my little lane where I live as he couldn't bring his van down .
All in all I definitely recommend Best Heating , their products and the price was the cheapest I could find after much scouring of the internet .
This was definitely the cheapest place we could find a Wii u available by some margin .
I was slightly apprehensive about buying such an expensive item from an " unknown " seller .
I needn't have been !
The whole process has been superb .
The item was cheap , in stock like they stated , dispatched almost immediately , arrived within 2 days , well packed and exactly as described .
I would also mention that their communcation all through the process was excellent .
Not only did I receive the usual " your order has been placed " email , I was kept informed of dispatch , estimated delivery day , the actual delivery day and the then the time of day ( to an hour ) when it would arrived .
And it did arrive exactly within the time slot - you don't get that often !!
Well done ShopTo . Net - we will defintitely be buying from you again !
Rescued tail light
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PARTS GEEKS .
LOL THE TAIL LIGHT LENS COVER ON MY DODGE WAS SMASHED WHEN SOME SOB RAN INTO ME AT THE GROCERY STORE AND LEFT THE SCENE .
I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX ALL THE DAMAGE , I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND THE PARTS GEEK AND ORDERED A LENS COVER AND IT ARRIVED IN A FEW DAYS AND WAS VERY REASONABLY PRICED .
I WILL RECOMMEND THEM AND WILL USE THEM AGAIN !
THANKS GEEKS I OWE YOU
YOU BIGGEST FAN
Everything was fine .
Thank you .
I ordered very simple stickers for closing bags .
I like to use my logo on stickers instead of scotch tape .
It all turned out fine .
I used my own artwork .
It was not overly priced either .
Thank you myownlabels . com
Don't advertise " free shipping " if you are going to jack me for a " handling " charge .
It 's deceptive and false advertising .
Use the website can easy to compare the price and find the cheaper price ticket .
High Quality products for really really good prices , fast shipping too !
West Coast Shaving is my number one site for any grooming products I'm looking to purchase .
They have all of the high quality product lines for what I've found to be the lowest prices .
The customer reviews and easy search options help a lot as well .
Does my pooch really need all that ?
Got my Petflow box o'goodies,and glad I only paid the intro price !
Did not value the items in the box as highly as you seemed , so don't feel that a monthly repeating would be in my pocketbooks best interest !
made getting out of a jamb easy
When I needed help and didn't know who to go through I looked them up online .
It has been a huge help
I was very happy to be referred to PureFormulas . com !
The prices are good and I like that they offer discount codes , but most of all the free shipping .
It 's been so easy to use .
All of my items have come packaged well .
I am very pleased .
Glad to have switched to ViewQwest !
Recently I have switched internet provider from Singtel to ViewQwest .
I encountered frustrating glitches that disrupted my viewing of videos on Hulu and contacted ViewQwest technical support team .
However , I am very happy with the efforts of ViewQwest in rectifying the error I had while using the VPN service .
To my pleasant surprise , the support team was very responsive and provided me with very good customer service .
The follow-up was good and eventually the problem was solved .
Compared to my previos provider , the service here is leaps and bounds better .
I do wish though that the VPN service works smoother and streams at a faster speed on the U.S and UK sites .
As of now , I'm a proud subscriber of Viewqwest fibrenet .
Great service and followup
Excellent service and will definitely use again
Excellent service .
Part was perfect .
I would recommend anyone to check this website and get their parts cheaper .
Very Fast Delivery
Very fast delivery , order a new computer and it arrived a few days later !
Outstanding value and wonderful service
Whilst searching for a bottle of whisky for my fathers birthday I came across Abbey Whisky .
I'm so glad I did , the choice of rare whisky is second to none , they have such an array of whiskies available that I don't believe could be found anywhere else .
As it was for a birthday I was able to use their birthday and celebrations filter which made finding the year of birth so easy !
The prices are very reasonable , after checking with other stores , I know I have got great value for money .
What sets this site apart from the others that I have used is the incredible customer service that you receive , very personal .
And along with the ( really ) fast and safe delivery , I would most definitely use again , and recommend to all .
5 paws up fast shipping no barks about my order !
Easy to order , great specials , fast shipping !
Met my expectations plus more !
They were very fast and I had no issues from ordering them to receiving them
Rats and spiders and bugs oh my
Critter control came in a timely manner and did so much work to help me get rid of the rat problem I was having .
Rats had gotten into my attic and were taking over my home and I had a brand new baby in the house .
They not only exterminated the rats but they also fixed all the spots where they thought the rats were entering the home .
I did have to do a follow up call to them a couple of weeks later and they responded very quickly .
Thank you critter control for helping make my house a home again !
Still NO ink !
I sent you a check at the end of April , which I knew would take some time for you to clear it and get the order out , but then about a month ago you sent this note indicating you had sent the ink ... and I still do not have my $50 worth of ink !
I am retired and don't have lots of money , so I trusted you .
I have needed this ink for some time and cannot afford to go and buy some until yours comes .
My order number is 3728369 .
I would like some kind of a response , please .
My address is 179 Betts Rd ., Orrington , Maine 04474 .
Free expedited Shipping
When I want something soon with no frills shipping , I can depend on B&H Photo and Video .
They always have competitive prices but the fast shipping is usually what convinces me to push the " Place Order " button !
I brought my old stethoscope back from the grave
Littmann gave up on me and couldn't help - this place had my part , mailed it right away and in four days I had my scope back up and running .
Only hiccup was the site billed me for shipping and so did PayPal .
I believe they fixed the double billing right away but I haven't checked my accounts yet .
Product was correct , easy to .
Install , and came exactly on time .
I'm 100% satisfied , and would definitely use parts geek again .
Superb service only let down by Parcel-force cannot comment on the bought as it was bought as a present for my son but he states its a cracking piece of kit does more than expected at the price would recommend JUNO to anyone 5 star company .

A Close Shave
Gordons Direct are a great company offering value for money and agreat service will use again goods were well packed and in pristine condition arriving 2 days after ordering thank you very much Gordons
The product quality was great and the value exceptional .
I also had a coupon that wasn't applied but their customer service got right on it and fixed everything .
Only problem I had was shipping .
When the products got here the 50 lb .
bag of puppy food was split into two parts .
There was pet food everywhere in the box .
Had to get extra containers to store it all .
Probably wasn't PetFlow 's fault but they should have a talk with their carrier .
Will order again and see what happens .
Very happy with Supplement Warehouse products and services !
I recommend them to everyone I know !
I purchase from them each time I have a need .
Great product , good price , fast shipping
This is a great products works very well

Very easy to use - I also called bacause I had made an error and this was corrected quickly and without fuss
The web site is easy to use , the options are clear to see and the call centre is supportive
Saved my life !!
I was in a pinch on a transcription that would have taken me about eight hours to do ( I'm a slow typer ) and Rev got it done for less than $30 .
Thumbs up !
Website would not allow me to choose standard shipping .
Good prices , but website needs a few things fixed .
Website would not allow me to choose standard shipping .
I had to upgrade my shipping just so that the system would accept it .
I was very upset about that .
I called the store and they were closed .
Quality and service is out of this world .
I have 8 fleet vehicles , all with DIY lettering .
I have never had an issue with any of their products .
Their customer service is fantastic .
I will never shop elsewhere for my decals .
Very good website
Not had any problems when dealing with Amazon this year .
Had a problem a couple of years ago with a tv I bought , but Amazon were fantastic and monitored all the emails back and forward between the company I bought the tv from and I got my money back .
Have every confidence when buying through Amazon .
Excellent service , items arrived very quickly .
I was very happy with the website , easy to use .
The items I bought are exactly as they were displayed on the website .
Really pleased with the delivery , they arrived before I was expecting them which is very good , especially at this time of year .
Thank you .
I experienced superior customer service , very efficient , quick and courteous .
My family and I were in need of a storage facility and we happen to drive by Self Storage .
Upon walking in we were immediately given eye contact and greeted with a friendly and warm smile .
We told the customer service agent what our needs were and he was able to answer all of our questions and concerns as well as accommodate us .
My family and I truly had a wonderful experience and would gladly refer any of our friends and family to use this service as well .
Thank you very much for all of your help in making our moving day less of a hassle .
It was such a joy to relieve some of the stress of the day :)
I love the product and the service was ace !
I think the idea of this is brilliant : titles make memorable and unique gifts .
This was the third title I've purchased , but this one was for myself .
I really like the fact that they send electronic copies of your documents ahead of the paper packages that are lovely presentations .
Great service , good prices and quick delivery
The fast service , reliability and competitive prices keep me coming back to shopto.net time after time !
Very close to factory parts
While my parts where not a perfect fit ( as expected of aftermarket parts anyway) , they fit reasonably well and I had no trouble getting everything I ordered installed .
Overall I would buy from them again since they were cheap with good , fast shipping .
I would definitely recommend Dolphin Fitness .
The prices are very reasonable and they have a big selection of fitness products .
Delivery are spot on !
Fastest delivery EVER !
It 's always nice when you can get a good deal on a DVD .
The icing on the cake was that I placed my order on Sunday ( evening) , and the DVD was delivered on Monday .
Less than 24 hours later !
Het is altijd leuk als je een goeie deal kan krijgen op een DVD , maar het toefje slagroom hier was dat ik op zondag ( avond ) m'n bestelling plaatste en op maandag hem al ontving !
Minder dan 24 uur later !
The photo 's were ok
the qualitity was acceptable , but the bonding was less
not happy , mass effect 3 still no show 5 days after release !
can't do review ! no game !
The fruit and plant arrangement was exceptional !
The fruit and plant arrangement I ordered for my mother was exceptional !
Thank you !
Reliable key replacement service
I was very happy to get replacement keys for my windows .
The keys arrived reasonably quickly after I had ordered them by post and were exactly what I had ordered .
Quick delivery and good product
I haven't used Simply Beach before but I am impressed with their speed of delivery and the product was good if a bit expensive .
I was able to use PayPal which was reassuring in terms of paying for it .
Excellent service received goods next day
Used this company a few times now and they are always reliable prompt with excellent service
having had a variety of purchases ow , i am a wowcher confirmed member !!
Service was very good .
Service and parts selection was very good .
Although , it would be helpful if there were installation instructions included .
Fast delivery of great Products !
Fast delivery of a great after Market Product !
My personal belonging are safe in a friendly place .
Every time I go put something in my storage locker or pick up something there is always a friendly face in the office who waves as you go in and out .
That 's a good feeling because you know that someone is there watching .
I do love this company they have the best prices on all of the supplements I use the only thing i dont like is high shipping costs when shipped to afghanistan since I am a deployed soldier .
The one website I use for my travel bookings .
I've been travelling around the world several times during the past two years , and I have to say thank you to Hostelworld for their service , because it really helped me find places , especially in countries where I had no idea how I'd deal with housing while not being able to speak in the native language - i . e .
They have a great database , so I found great places wherever I went to ( USA , New Zealand , Australia , Indonesia , Japan , Great Britain , Germany and Switzerland) .
The city guides are also quite interesting and a good starting point to discovering the cities , though that part is not enough to plan a full trip .
You need more than just a simple general guide .
The bookings work great , I never had any troubles with my bookings .
Sometimes I had to cancel , and it 's all correctly managed , safe , and more importantly , it 's all really cheap !
Way cheaper than what I could get if I tried by myself without having a centralized source for booking .
It really helps a lot .
Excellent product and service
Replacement Oral B toothbrush heads ordered and supplied very quickly .
The product is excellent just as good as the original .
Very good customer service .
When there was a little problem , it was solved within few hours with their help line .
I would recomend this server to mostly everyone .
Also they have a really good customer support when something happens .
Very pleased with the wedding favor labels I ordered .
They arrived earlier than expected and looked perfect !
The bride and groom received many compliments on them !
BookIt . com ROCKS !!
BookIt . com ROCKS !!!

Would use Euroflorist again !
The review and order process was clear .
Great choices .
Highly recommend Euroflorist !!!
1 day Late delivery , split delivery and smashed vase .
The line above says it all really .
Delivered the flowers a day late !, the vase and the flowers arrived seperately ?!
and when the vase arrived it was smashed ..
I reported the problem and received a standard email reply which talked about flowers and not my problem of a broken vase .
They did send out a new vase to my mum in law but it was hardly great service and I thought they wud have at least sent the flowers again too as way of an apology .
I will never use them again .
Excellent speedy service every time .
Every order has been fast and efficient & well packed ,
A great company to do business with :-)
Best company for anything audio/video , service and selection cant be beat
B&H has what you want , delivers it when you want it with accurate pricing , knowledgable staff and a reliable return policy , should you need to return anything .
Haven't let me down in over 20 years in the video business , I pass the B&H name on every time someone needs the go to source for Audio/Video .
Best price , great product , excellent customer service - slow delivery
Best price on the internet , by far .
Took over a week for the item to arrive ( though this is within stated delivery times) .
Sent by courier , and very well packaged .
I will buy from this seller again ..
Best price , good communications , fast delivery .
If you're after high quality outdoors kit and good prices , shop with these people .

Identity Guard does it 's job and is a worthwhile service .
They report to you are pertinent information in a timely and accurate manor .
We do recommend this service .

Boxes of cat litter often have rips or holes with litter leaking out .
Food bags are fine .
We also ordered the 14lb box of Fresh Step Premium litter and were notified that it had been discontinued .

Daughter took the car to the garage who were expecting her .
They fitted the new tyre and swopped a wheel rear to front to even up the tyre wear .
Both wheels were balanced and fitted for an additional fee of £6 . OO which was good value .
The mechanic was interested and helpful .
Simply the best cycling supplier .
Merlin have long been the 1st place I turn for cycling equipment .
I cant rate them highly enough .
fantastic price and service !
great price .... delivered when promised ..
I have always experienced good service when ordering from Niven & Joshua , and I would highly recommend them .
Very fast shipping and no mistakes !
Partsgeek sold me struts and shocks at about 60% of what NAPA wanted for the exact same shocks and struts .
I ordered them on Monday and they were on my doorstep Thursday when I got home from work .
3 days wait was totally worth the money .
And shipping was free !
Labels are easy to create and looks great on my wine bottles !
I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to create labels .
worst experience ever
this website quoted us a room rat of 104 dollars a night for a two night stay .
we were expecting 208 plus taxes etc ... they tried charging my credit card 408 dollars then when we called to cancell couldn't find our reservation number etc .... sounded like a scam so we cancelled the credit card and told the company to investigate they still tried charging our card 1 week later .
bunch of scumbags
Brooklyn location needs audit .
Poor time management
I spent 2 and a half hours having one tire replaced on my car .
A town and country van that came in after me received 4 tires and an alignment and was done just as my car was done .
Manager blamed it on a busy day .
I blame it on poor time management .
Employees were seen joking and eating in the garage .
There is no excuse for taking so long to replace one tire especially when they knew I was coming in .
I will not return to this location nor will I recommend this location to others .
Prices were reasonable
and delivery was prompt .
Fast and easy
Best price I could find and they came in one day . very happy with tire crazy
I have made many purchase through the years at B&H always the same .
Great service .
Wonderful Screens , Fast shipping , Low Prices !
I got two screens till now from this website .
They worked flawlessly .
The price for those screens are very low too when compared to other retailers and in other websites .
Shipping is very fast .
Overall I would rate this website 9 out of 10 .
TOTALLY RIDICULOUS !!!!!!!
I ordered my name necklace on November 26,201 2 it was shipped out on December 6 .
I have NOT received my necklace or a refund and this was a Christmas gift for my daughter she 's going to be so disappointed and the first thing I read on their website was " it would be here by Christmas " don't promise anything you can't keep this website is a scam and I will be reporting it to the Bettered Business Bureau !!!!
no phone number now tracking number Get auto reply email nothing stated that it would take this long to receive my package ...
Now I feel like a true Scotsman .
Although I'm not able to actually live on my property , I feel much closer to my ancestors now than I did before .
It feels very good to be able to preserve land for all the flora and fauna in a spot that looks so beautiful .
Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this project .
Excellent service , prompt delivery , quality products
I've used Cult pens on many occasions and i always received excellent service and prompt delivery aswell as providing me with a vast range of pens , pencils etcthat i can ' t purchase on the high street
I was pleased with how quickly the parts were delivered to me .
No tricks , no delay
Buying my air ticket with SkyTours was very easy and quick .
The price you pay is exactly the one you find in your search ( there are no additions in the last minute) .
It was also the cheapest ticket I was able to find online .
Great purchase !
What was that blur ?
I was my order arriving almost before I left the sight .
Service and products are great .
Very good customer support and on-time delivery
They stick to promises and if not happy , they will make ends meet somehow .
Good doing business with them and plan to keep buying food for my dog from them .
Excellent product and the freebie was a very generous bonus .
Completly hassle free from picking my product to receiving it through my letter box .
Will definately be back again !
So Far So Good .... Great Company !
I've only ordered twice from PureFormulas .
Both times the product was delivered promptly and met all my expectations .
Prices are reasonable and with free shipping I will be a repeat customer .
Just booked car parking at Manchester over easter holiday period for a great deal .
website was straightforward and all good to go .
Very easy to use and efficient service
The site was very easy to use , the prints were delivered quickly and packaged securely and safely .
The final version received looks excellent and very professional .
The price per card is very reasonable but the postage is quite steep and really increases the amount you were initially planning on spending .
Best Hotel Rates !
I used olotels.com three times so far and my girlfriend used it one time to book hotels , and the rates we got were far less that any other site , or even travel agents !
The rates are inclusive of taxes and fees , and at the Wynn Las Vegas , they even gave us 2 brunch buffet vouchers !
I always start my hotel search on olotels.com .
Love my glasses
Description and photos were accurate .
They are just perfect and make a statement .
Delivery was on time and a great follow up with rep .
I will be returning soon
realy great product and shiping

LOVE THE AMAZING STYLES
I've been buying from Amy for the past 4 or even 5 yrs .

And don't raise it up
I'm a first time customer to 10dollarmall .
It didn't take a long time for my shoes to get to my house either .
It was definitely a great price and great quality .
I am considering ordering something else and I recommend this site to my friends and family .
I saved so much money .
Everything was as described .
Received in amount of time given at checkout .
Excellent people to deal with .
Sometimes being a " Bully " is a GOOD thing ...

Great customer service when I have questions , also .
Very fast service , genuine product , great price .
I received a really nice watch from Jacobtime , at a great price , although I was disappointed my first choice wasn't in stock , but not indicated on the website .
I'm still looking for that Bulova Precisionist with the rose gold finish and black face .
All in all , a great deal .
I wish they had a Mondaine black face Swiss train watch .
Thank you Jacobtime .
Previous orders fine ; haven't used latest purchase yet .
Received fast but haven't used it yet .
Great customer service
Great customer service fast shipping great shirts everyone was pleased would recommend this company to everyone
very good place and nice prices but delivery to europe is little slow .
Top draw !
Quality products fair play , feeling and seeing the gains using TPW ! And I always get email alerts on offers and discounts on a weekly basis !
Top draw bundles
I really enjoy using ' my protein ' products !
! I only use them when the half price bundles come on offer !
! For what you get is fantastic for your money ! Its just a shame they don't do the bundles more often
Easy to use
I couldn't believe how easy the site was to use .
Beginning to end took a couple of minutes and was very straightforward .
Now I just have to hope I don't need to make a claim .
Excellent service from real people !
The website works well , and the prompt response from the staff at LFH made it a pleasure to deal with them .
Quality of packaging and instructions made delivery and return painless .
The goods I ordered came quickly and , when I found out that I had ordered the wrong thing , they phoned in response to my e-mail and exchanged them for the correct item within 24 hours .
Excellent to have an efficient , easy-to-use one stop shop .
Excellent service , but I only seemed to be able to book two Italian train journeys at once ... or maybe out was a faulty internet connection .
Careful and attentive service
A very good value for money product delivered within a reasonable timescale , and two Quality Sweets included in the box !
Neatly packaged and very good service .
Even the dog liked the technician .
Pete King installed our alarm system .
He was really friendly and efficient .
He had a fun sense of humor and was very helpful in educating us about the system .
Yesterday an hvac came to the house and our dog almost tried to kill him , but Pete had the dog at ease the whole time .
I trust her opinion of strangers above my own sometimes .
He is clearly a good guy and a pro at his job .
Great Shopping Experience
BandH is a great lace to find any kind of A/V equipment you need
Lenstore is fast efficient and value for money - a lot cheaper than high street stores
I have tried Lenstore because a friend recommended me and was pleasantly surprised when I received my order as they were the exact same as I receive monthly from Specsavers .
I am going to save myself half the amount that I was paying Specsavers for the same product .
Great Customer Service when dealt with a query
I picked this site from a comparison site and bought my insurance for my family , after realising I had made a mistake , I rang the next day and got an immediate refund and I purchased the correct policy .
Awesome experience .
Delivered quickly .
They have really cute stuff forreally cheap .
Cult Pens are the go-to link with ink .
When Cult Pens first appeared on my Internet radar I was amazed .
For months I would salivate over their extensive range of calligraphic joy , in itself a pleasure of ink-based browsing .
Lurking like some kind of stalker , it was with careful planning that I ' came in ' for my first transaction , the purchase of an artefact of pure beauty - the Lamy Al-Star .
I ordered requisite ink supplies , ticked the box for the free Lamy ballpoint , and all dropped through my mailbox exquisitely packed and perfectly accounted for within 48 hours of me tapping on glass on an iPad .
Come to Cult Pens .
They are Cultish .
They do pens .
You should joint the cult .
Use Cult Pens .
They are the best .
Happy Poodle !
Fast shipping !
Reliable service .
Great products .
My poodle was happy so what more is there to say ???
Order today .. you won't be disappointed .
Best website for Asian clothes :) .
Got a lot of gifts from here for my birthday and WOW !!
They have the best clothes that match my taste !
Should buy more clothes from here on !!
5 stars !!!!!
NEVER AGAIN !
Initially I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a online store this seemed to be , but their customer service is appalling .
After I had made my order , I received an email saying that I had to send them a copy of an identification document as some kind of a security check before they post my item .
I thought sure no problem , so I did .
A couple of hours later , I received the same email again , so I thought hmm .. maybe the didn't get it , I'll send it again .
However I ended up receiving the same email a second time .
And then 8 times more .
Of course I tried reaching them via their customer inquiry on their website , explaining I had no idea what 's going on , that I had no confirmation that they received the copy of my ID or my order properly , and I had done so several times but I hadn't received even one response .
I eventually managed to get through to them on the phone and they said that my order had been shipped .
After about a week and a half I saw that via the order tracking that my items were due for delivery that day so I waited .
Nothing came all day so I checked the tracking and saw that ' the delivery attempt was unsuccessful ' because no one answered , so they left a card .
But I was in all day and no one had left any card .
I called the delivery company and it turned out that Scubastore had given them the wrong address , so I had to rush to a depot to collect it , which also cost me .
It was a nightmare and I will never shop there again .
I would have put 1 star however I don't think there was any malicious intent , but that 's because it felt like there was no intent of any kind , just indifference and complete lack of communication or response , which is probably worse as you're left utterly clueless as to what is going on .
Lenstore is an excellent service
Lenstore is a fast , convenient and cheap alternative way to receive contact lenses .
I have complete control over what I order , whereas when I ordered through the opticians I found I had a backlog of supplies and felt I was wasting money .
I have used the service for over a year and found that my orders have never taken longer than two days ( perfect for me as I tend to leave ordering until the last minute ! ) .
A really great service , I'd recommend it to anybody as the sensible option .
Needed a scart splitter , Checked online for best value .
bought this one .
Good value for money , excellent and fast delivery , perfect for the job .
Blind leading blind
Excellent value for the money , easy to install and work perfectly .
low price , fast delivery , great product
I bought a complete heat pump system , ( inside and out) .
My heating/AC problems are solved .

Great price with great shipping
Very happy with the order
My flowers was late delivery because they doesn't know before they don't delivery in Coquimbo Chile .. was really bad experience for me , never ever buy here again
Would highly recommend .
Service was fast and efficient and the cheapest I could find in the area so I would definately recommend .
Staff were polite and helpful .
Fast service , excellent part
Had to get a replacement tail-light due to damage from a car-wash .
I went back to PartsGeek because their prices beat all the others I found .
We purchased 2 headlights last year and had such great service we knew we would find another great value .
It´s a great system
Always worked effectively , quickly and with spending minimum in the currency exchange
no hassle service
i was really pleased with my first experience using lenstore , i was able to buy my usual brand and have them delivered to my door , no trying to find time to go into town , no hunting through the paper-work to find my prescription and the added bonus of a phonecall from lensstore to make sure everything was ok !!
Fantastic site , every order comes every time , couldn't ask for more
I have a 1986 CJ 7 that I use as a hunting vehicle .
Needless to say it takes some abuse and is in constant need of repair .
4WD has always had my parts at reasonable prices and great service .
I would highly recommend them
its for testing
Great selection , amazingly fast delivery
I've bought from Healthy supplies twice now and each time have been very pleased with the selection of products available and the speed at which the order was fulfilled .
Love to see a way packaging could be reduced without damage to goods in transit but I guess that 's being worked on ?
great value , even better service , highly recommended
I ordered dog food on Friday and it was delivered on Saturday , the prices were lower than competitors and there was no charge for postage and packaging - highly recommended , will definitely use again .
Fantastic service , couldn't be bettered !
I ordered lenses through contactforlenses.com , they weren't despatched as contrary to information when I ordered them , they were out of stock .
They didn't think to inform me , waiting until I contacted them10 days after order - they'd been much more efficient debiting my credit card !
Desperate as I needed lenses to drive over Christmas I tried Lenstore .
My prescription isn't that common yet they had it in stock , they despatched later that day & they arrived 2 days later .
Delighted with the service and at such a good price , highly recommended .
I got the items as ordered and in just two days time .
For an international dispatch with ordinary post mail that 's just incredible !
loved the sunglasses , got it in 10 days
The product was very good and the service fast .
The only remark that is negative is that the Roberto Cavalli sunglasses that I bought had the actual logo on each side of the sunglasses and it was made out of rhinestones .
I had 4 rhinestones missing and because they are very shiny , it is quite noticeable .
Given that I paid $300 , I would have expected the product to be in a perfect condition .
It was totally not worthed to have to contact SmartBuyGlasses to fix it as I had to pay for the courier shipping and wait another 2-3 weeks for the fix .
Your site was easy to navigate .
I was told about your site and it was easy to find .
I had no problem finding what I wanted and check out was simple .
Real people at the other end of the ' phone !
Telephoned for advice on sizes of a ladies wetsuit shown on the website .
We were given good practical guidance and a prompt service when we ordered .
Good advice from very helpful Staff , with delivery of the bike sooner than expected .
I enquired about a Mondraker Foxy shown on the Merlin website and was guided about the suitability of the size available .
On the telephone Becky created an account for me as we spoke and was able to reserve it with a deposit and was available to complete the purchase the following day .
I was advised that the despatch would take a number of days to allow the workshop to complete their checks etc , but in fact the delivery was 4 days earlier than expected allowing me to get out a weekend sooner than anticipated .
Many thanks for a great service .
The card came really fast .
I'm pleased at how fast the card came .
Better than some other gift card sellers .
quick , easy & honest
super easy to use , customer service top-notch .
pretty much no-hassle ( unless you are in a hurry and it 's an Orthodox Holiday…then it 's OY VEY !!
) Still , 47 weeks or so out of the year , the best way to go .
A very happy four year old
My daughter has wanted ariels costume for ages and was very excited when she got it , she has been wearing it at every opportunity and it hasn't disappointed her .
Speedy delivery also made this purchase worthwhile
So nice and easy to make a claim !
So our microwave stopped working completely .
There was absolutely no power and it would not turn on .
I started an online claim with Square Trade .
I needed to email them a copy of the receipt because I not previously done that .
I hadnt heard anything back in 24 hours , so I gave them a call .
They were able to find the email with the receipt and immediately refund my money for the microwave .
I shipped the microwave back after printing out the shipping label they emailed to me .
They pay for the shipping .
I am so happy with them .
That microwave only lasted a year and was just beyond the manufacturers warrenty .
I am really glad I went with Square Trade and I would buy with them again .
Have flown internationally with various airlines & used various booking agents as such and find ebookers provides my preferred airlines ": KLM " & " Luftansa " with the better itineraries with fewer stops & shorter lay-overs .
Price wise they are a bit pricier with their service charges & taxes but to me worth the bit extra for the convenience of scheduled arrivals & departure times .
Itineraries of flights seem to remain intact & stable without last minute changes or re-routings becoming necessary .
In air flight times seem more direct & shorter minimizing " jet lag ".
I would recommend others try this company for confidence .

Priceline is the best

The Best !
I ordered a small bottle of the Pet Corrector after reading reviews .
I received it very quickly .
We ran out fast and wanted to order another can .
That day I received an email from PetFlow featuring the Pet Corrector on sale so I ordered a jumbo can .
It arrived promptly .
Pet Flow is really fast , effiicient and good priced .
I will continue to buy pet supplies from them !
I got my books in a speedy and timely manner just in time for my classes to start !
Bookbyte is a cheap , easy site to use to rent your text books .
I love ordering them through here over any other site .
Good place to find gear !
Easy site to use .
Wish there were people !
Andrew Clausen extremely helpful !
Ordered smoothly , and received on time .
Very satisfied .
Andrew Clausen helped ordering so nicely and smoothly !
Looked at quite a few reviews ( all good ) , and read all the info on the site before I ordered so was well aware of the 12 week wait for the lamp but was well worth it when it came .
1st class service
would be better if driver took packaging away
They go above and beyond
The service is amazing and the products are fabulous .
one of the best deals in a long time by far
try calling on the phone takes a while or no response e-mail its a little long to wait as i like to get things done fast .
however the wait was well worth the wait .
i try to keep my money local but by far a saved lots from parts geek now im telling all my friends about this place hope to do business again im happy to have come across this place
Love YesStyle !!
I'm always looking for new and innovative style that is different from the majority .
YesStyle provides that !!
Living in the US , we can get stuck in a certain style that is fad following , boring and the same for everyone .
The designers from YesStyle provide me with the look i'm looking for and my husband is enjoying it just as much as i am :) .
Excellent service and price .
Fast and efficient delivery .
Highly recommended .
I bought one of the premium start up kits and a small selection of juices on my first visit .
The range of products was good and delivery was very fast .
I had a slight problem with my battery losing charge .
However the guy I spoke to couldn't have been more helpful and exchanged it no problem and my new one is perfect .
I have since been back and ordered more juices and a Lavatube for my husband , which he 's really pleased with ( I was tempted to buy him the pipe - maybe next time !
Overall , I think this is a great company and I will be buying from them again .
Design 911 is efficient , professional and have good prices - highly recommended
what he said !
simple and easy to use
I was able to book the car I wanted when the hirers direct website said it was unavailable .
Quick and Easy
This made shipping my clubs quick and easy with the relief of having $ 1,000 insurance included .
Will defiantly use this service again .
VERY EFFICIENT DELIVERED WHEN SAID WITH LOTS OF UPDATES ON DELIVERY I I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
ordered my supplies from them and they arrived in a couple of days really pleased with them
quick and easy to find what you want took only 10 minutes great
Perfect .... Nothing less than that ...
Had to book a last minute hotel in bkk from hk airport ... i found that there is no connecting flight to India today from bkk .... spent less than 10 min on agoda and got my booking done ... what else can we expect in the last minute ..
Great program - great price !
I love PetFlow and the auto-ship program !
My dog eats a special dog food .
PetFlow has great variety at a great price !
I am definitely a fan !
HAPPY LEFT HANDER !!!
I found this site by chance , and I'm really please I did .
I've been fascinated with pens for 40 years and its great to have found a website with such a great selection including some great special offers and limited editions i . e .
a recent Warhol collection .
I have no doubt ill be checking out ' Cult Pens ' again very soon .
Great prices ; Reliable
My buddy referred me to Supplementwarehouse . com about 2 years ago and it has remained a constant source of muscle building power for me since .
I , too , have been a customer of GNC for many years .
I still go there , in case , I need to re-up at the snap of the finger , but supplementwarehouse blows GNC out of the water in comparison .
The retail prices are nearly cut in half , if not more , and I usually get everything within a couple days .
The shipping costs are always an eyesore but overall , this site is the best around .
SelfStorage , Priced well with clean and neat facilities with people that care !
You need to check out Selfstorage for your storage needs !
They are reasonably priced , clean , and well kept .
The manager is informed , friendly , helpful and efficient .
Great route ( shorter tour) , interesting tour , comfy bus .
I would not bother with the longer tour - we did it as couldn't be bothered to change buses with the children but it was too long , and also there we then had to change buses at Baker Street , or sit on ours for 20 minutes until it left again .
We'd not been told this would happen although the brochure says it 's possible .
Also the bus driver got off at one point for at least 5 minutes so that delayed us further .
Bus stopping point could be signed posted more clearly from Victoria .
Good product great service .
I found your co . on the internet .
Your price was fair .
The part was correct for my vehicle , and fit perfectly .
Great Service !!
Fantastic prices , fast shipping , product exactly as described , can't ask for anything more !!
Great , as expected and advertised !
This is the site that Sigvaris recommended to me to purchase , since I am unable to buy directly from the company .
reliable as always
Ordered some Christmas gifts as I do every year .
Delivery was fast within 2 days , which helped as I had ordered a little late .
I received my order on the 24th , just in time for Christmas .
Reliable as ever .
Money was taken out of my checking account twice ( 592.00 twice) .
That is a lot of money .
My bank said if I could get a letter from bookit stating I would get a refund they would put the money back in my account .
I had to call bookit several times and was on hold for 45 min .
each time .
Each time I called = no one seemed to know what I was talking about .
It was very frustrating .
Another lesson learned as one cannot believe what one reads .
Seeing is believing .
This was a very disappointing experience .
The Richmond Hotel was supposed to be renovated .
What year is the question ?
Location was good but the rooms and pool area etc .
was very sub standard in my opinion .
It would be very difficult to trust Bookit . com in the future for any travel needs .
Easy Cruise Booking
No problems booking sunset cruise in Destin .
Looking forward to it !
Excellent service !
Easy to order and arrived on time .
No issues at all
Highly recommended supplier - will definately use again
Ordered a substantial and delicate Swarovski Disney crystal and faultless service from David Shuttle .
Very prompt delivery and well packaged gift for our daughter 's 21st birthday .
Nice touch of free chocolates with the order too , which shows how much care they place on the customer .
Fast & friendly
It only took less than 7 minutes to find what I needed and reserve the storage space .
Exactly what we hoped for !
Thanks for the quick delivery and great customer service for the sunglasses I ordered for a wedding favor .
Would definitely order from you again .
Bookbyte Doesn't Byte
Excellent company offering books at prices way below college books stores .
You can purchase or rent a textbook which is great !!
We more often rent because they are not texts that would need to be kept for reference .
We purchase the books we want to keep in a refernce library .
It is the customers choice !!!
i refer you to all my colleages with children entering or about to enter college .
Totally the way to go .
Shipping is Fast and FREE !!
Bookbyte also pays shipping to have the books returned at the end of the rental period ... You just can't go wrong !
Hostelworld is great .
I book a hostel in Chengdu from Hostelworld website , and that was a nice experience .
Post borer posted early
The whole buying experience was good and beyond my expectations .
Confirmation of order and regular order progress updates were received at regualar intervals .
Delivery was very prompt ( earlier than estimated) .
The product could not be found cheaper on any website other than an auction site where it was on offer for the same price secondhand plus postage .
Why buy secondhand when you can buy new at the same price with a guarantee ?
Product is excellent as was the buying experience .
Happy to recommend this trader .
Just as it should be !
Excellent range of products which made it difficult to choose just one .
We went for the toadstools feature and purchased online .
It was a very easy transaction , no problems whatsoever .
The purchased was immediately confirmed and a delivery day/date was given for the next working day ( delivery was included within the purchase price) .
Delivery was by a reputable courier and it was delivered the next day .
The item was very well packaged and the actual water feature was pleasantly beyond our expectations .
We followed the enclosed ( and simple !
) instructions and was up and literally running within 10 minutes .
The water feature looks great in our back garden , so much so we are considering another one to match it .
This is how all purchases should be , no problems , easy transactions , delivery as promised and top quality products .
I would definately recommend UK Water Features , they have set the standard very high and wish all stores and sellers would be as good as them in appreciating the customer .
Thanks B&H !
As a regular customer , I know what to expect in the way of service and quality .
Every transaction has gone smoothly and all products are what I expect .
Would recommend it
We have just moved into a new property which is fueled by oil , all previous properties have used the main gas supplies .
This is the first time I have used Boilerjuice following a recommendation from a neighbour and I am very pleased with the service I have received .
I contacted customer services for advice prior to ordering , the agent was very helpful and knowledgable .
I would recommend it to other potential customers .
Don't let this shop slip the Net !!
I typed in Net Curtains UK on Google .
Woodyatt was the 1st site after the sponsered links .
I found the site extremely easy to use .
The ready reckoner was absolutley brilliant .
I found the payment methods easy and straight forward .
The package arrived on time and it 's arrival had been heralded by email
The curtains had been wrapped seperately so identifying which room was which was easy as well
All in all a very very good shop th deal with .
Throughly recommended .
Friendly hassle free staff , and a great price
I picked up the car from Manchester , and after being shown how to use the push button start
( I'm still useing a key ignition car ) from one of the friendly staff I was on my way , the car also had a sat nav at no extra cost .
So my hire experience was hassle free
terrible experince here
sent me the wrong part , reordered , yet to receive the wrong part again im pretty much done doing business here .
If ur looking for fast shipping , and good service look elsewhere
Fast service for a last minute gift
They were extremely fast for a
Last minute gift for my wife .
The pearls were beautiful and put a great smile on her face !
Quick and easy but a bit annoyed with booking fee .
Quick and easy but a bit annoyed with booking fee .
the service is superb , quick , and easy to to online .
i have had my contact lenses from lenstore for a while now , and am vey satisfied with the whole package , so try them and see for yoursel f.i wont be changing to anyone else .
Great Service , Great Product
We needed 25 engraved flashdrives in less than a week .
The staff was vey helpful and the order was processed the same day .
We recieved our flashdrives in beautiful black leather cases in time for our academic awads cermony .
The students loved them .
We will definitely order from Flashbay again .
Almost Delivered Before It 's Ordered
Ordering is a breeze .
Very user friendly web site .
Great value .
Remarkable how quickly the delivery is .
quality parts at cheap prices
fully loaded brake calipers for a couple bucks more than autozones plain calipers
Very easy to do , quick efficient process
love it it 's the best ever
this is the best yes yes yes eys cannot stop
BEST supplement website !
I have used several websites to order my supplements and supplement warehouse is by far the best .
The ease of finding what I was looking for was great , the prices were better , but the best part was the price match !
I couldn't believe it !
I will definitly be recommending this to my friends !
Easy simple process
The whole process was easy to go through , they give helpful information on how many boxes are needed for your items , all free post , good courier service , the only negative thing i would say is that it took a long long time for the money to be sent to my account .
You have to wait for the items to arrive which for me took around 13 days , then they have to pass the items to the check team which took another day , then the items were checked and the information passed onto the team that deals with the cash sending , this took 2-3 days , then the money goes out in batches which can take between 3-5 days , THEN depending on your bank it can take a further 3-5 days for the money to be accepted into your account .
For me it took almost a month .
Brilliant , fast , hassle free service and a great products .
After i purchased my items they despatched them that same day , despite one of the items being an extremely large one .
It was delivered the next day and full tracking info was provided .
When i e-mailed to let them know that i'd got the item they replied very quickly .
Their reply was personal and gracious , showing a real human side which few big music retailers have .
DEFINATELY recommend these guys .
Plus their prices are great too !!
Always amazing !
I buy from The Whiskey Exchange 2 or 3 times a year for various birthday presents for the older generation ( one of which I'm slowly joining -insert pity noise-) Everytime it arrives promptly and always tastes amazing .
Friendly customer service
The service was acceptable but the communication could have been better .
Excellent service !
Bought a pair of sunglasses Friday afternoon and got the product on my hand on Tuesday morning ( Finland) .
I asked via email about the inventory beforehand and the reply came within 12 hours .
Thank you for your excellent service , I'm sure to use your services also the next time I'm ordering sunglasses !
They were very nice and helpful .
After a bit of confusion , PetBest got me the dog foods I needed quickly and even gave me a small discount for my patience .
I will order again from them because they were so nice !
They also carry a brand of food which is not very well known but I need it for a dog with allergies and yeast problems .
Perfect source !
MrChewy is a perfect way for me to get the brands my diabetic Scottie needs to help him maintain as much of the life he knew before the diabetes as possible .
Living in a small , rural setting means one of two things ... spending time , gas and energy driving 50 miles to the closest source or letting MrChewy do it for me .
I choose the latter and it is perfect for me .
Order was filled and out in less than 24 hours and I've opted for the automatic delivery , so unless I need to make changes , it 's effortless for me .
Of the many online glasses retailers this one is the best !
I've tried numerous other online suppliers of prescription glasses with poor results -incorrect prescriptions , long delays etc .
Not Glasses direct : their service is excellent and the order is fulfilled really quickly , in the last case within 5 days !
They are developing the website so that one can printout a picture of the frames at full size which is useful because one can lay your own specs onto the picture to determine if your desired frames will fit .
They need to do this with all frames -it 's such a good idea .
All my specs orders will go through this company .
good value and minimum fuss
I ordered a set of winter tyres for my daughter 's Clio- the choice on the Black Cirlces website was good and the fitting was carried out very efficiently - I'd definately use the service again .
Simple and easy to use !
Using Boilerjuice it 's easy to get a competitive price for home heating oil without all the phoning around , with the added bonus that the final price can be lower than you first thought if you qualify for the discount .
The supply usually arrives pretty promptly too so all in all I find the service very useful .
I recently bought the Barbour Bristol jacket from country attire .
The main attraction for purchasing it from this site was the free hood .
Barbour jackets are the same price everywhere you look but the option of a free hood which usually costs about £30 was very nice .
Also the free next day recorded delivery was very good as well .
I would definitely buy from this site again and recommend it to others
We are very pleased with the service and the way way we were treated .
This is our third visit at the
Enfield store .
We got friendly and fast service and the waiting room was clean and comfortable .
Great service , great prices .
I found the exact products I had been searching for .
I think the service was great and the website was simple to navigate .
The products arrived more quickly that I had presumed due to the weather .
I installed the parts the same day they came .
Envirophone is great !
Wait a few days and have your money almost instantly
Easy to navigate , find stock and delivery second to none ,
Problem , BUT still happy .
As I said in the title , I had a problem in that the Cross Trainer was damaged , I immediately phoned and was told to continue unpacking and send photographs of any damage .
In total I found 4 seperate pieces of damage .
When I phoned I spoke to a very helpfull Lady and was offered either parts sent out or a swap .
I opted for the swap and was told to confirm via an E-Mail they would send me , a date for the swap .
10 minutes after putting the phone down I had confirmed and the cross trainer was swapped the very next day by a very polite driver .
I am happy with my cross trainer and appreciate that things do get damaged in transit however it was quite clear that my original cross trainer had been opened and the damage to the outside of the box was quite severe , I could only ask for maybe better checks before dispatch .
Jolly good all round
My mother wanted some new curtains , but her windows were an awkward size .
Stand Up Woodyatt !!!
Excellent value and quality and prompt service - just what she wanted .
I recomend !
It 's fantastic !
The right parts at the best price !
I completed an air suspension to coil spring conversion at got best parts and price from Partsgeek !
I'll be back !
A little expensive for what you get .
Nice apartment but suffers from ill fitting doors that rattle when the building front door is opened and excessive noise every time a neighbour uses the staircase .
SOme serious sound proofing of the stairs is required .
Product always available
Always satisfied .
Product I want is always in stock and shipped quickly
Great service .
Prompt , good price and a lovely freebie !!
Our cats won't starve thanks to MrChewy !
Best price we've found on Orijen cat food , plus the fast auto shipping make this an excellent choice .
Our cats were throwing up regularly , even with so-called premium food like Hills Science Diet .
Since we switched to Orijen they no longer barf !
Fast Delivery and great prices !
All my parts arrived exactly when they were scheduled , within just a few days of my order .
The prices on the parts were almost 30% less than the next closests competitor online parts supplier prices I could find and the shipping costs were less than half of the closest competitor .
I definetly will purchase from PartsGeek . com again .
Fantastic products , superior service !
I have just received my first order from Flashbay and have to say I'm blown away by the product and the service - I'll be back for more soon !
Basic car rental with good service
Sunny Cars is a company that offers basic car rental .
Everything was arranged perfectly , waiting time on airport not too long , quick access to the car and good services .
Mes besteld , perfecte service , goede communicatie en snelle levering
Top resource for round-the-world trip
We are travelling around the world and hostelworld.com is our main source for booking hotels or hostels and finding out what kind of activities a city has to offer .

Fast speedy service with a free item thrown in for good measure .
Well recommended .
Speedy delivery .
Great products at Fantastic prices !
Love their prices and all their specials and discounted dog treats .
They have the best prices on dog treats out of any other pet website , hands down !
i will be shopping with deep blue fightwear again .
cant say anymore than that .
Lauren Walsh at rushmypassport.com was very helpful and answered all my questions .
Even ones that are probably self explanatory .
I would recommend shima uma for your ink purchase , it was easy to orderand a good price and it arrived within 3 days !
found they were selling it cheaper on ebay
Great company , no issues and product arrived fast !
Exactly as described , arrived fast , great communication from company .
I will shop again when I need anything !
Very quick and easy
I had seen the ads on TV and was a little apprehensive about using this site , however I should not have worried .
Everything was easy to use , the postage bag was sent to me quickly and payment was forwarded to me within a couple of days ( even though it was the week before christmas) .
They paid an extremely fair price for the phone I sent at a time when I really needed some money .
I'm now looking for more of our old phones to send through !
the best it could be !
fast , simple and cheap !
These filters are very good and the price is better than prices in local stores .
Huge selection , great prices ...
I hate throwing away ' disposable ' pens , but it can be more expensive and time consuming finding suitable refills .
But Cult Pens have a huge range and prices that make it worthwhile - you should check out how many colours are available for Pilot G2 pens .
And whenever I'm browsing there 's always some new or limited edition pen that I have to resist buying !
Free delivery with £10+ order too ...
Had so many deals .. by far the best priced supplements around !
Ordering from here for over a yr noe
Slow Shipping/No Tracking
Ordered on Monday , received order the next Monday with no tracking available , I didn't know if I had been ripped off or if the item was really on the way .
This caused an uneasy feeling about this company and caused unwanted and unneeded stress .
I will probably not use this company again , even though they had the lowest price , the last thing most of need in our lives is more stress .
Excellent , FAST service .
I was very pleased with their easy communication and was happily surprised with how great the buttons looked , especially with how fast we needed them made !
I have always loved B&H .
The provide great service and quality items .
Fast shipping & parts were a direct replacement
My upper coolant hose was leaking .
Parts showed up faster than quoted and were a perfect fit .
Smooth transaction with no surprises
Had my order within the week ( I'm in Texas) ... Everything as described .
They had everything I was looking for .
crystal clear , reliable , good value !
Would not buy from anyone else .
Each time I need new lenses I research THE best deal , Lens tore consistently come up top for value and service .
Economy , efficiency and so easy .
I love the fact that Boiler Juice informs me of special deals and best prices .
I previously spent an inordinate amount of time getting online quotes and calling delivery companies for best prices at random times - Boiler Juice tells ME when oil prices are at a 3 month low and that is when I order !
I recommend you check them out .
It will save you time and money .
Great price , great service
As shopping goes - this is about as good as it gets ... easy website , great communication and the goods arrived as promised .
helpful and quick
I would use them again` thankyou
Ordered very late Wednesday evening , arrived 1st thing Friday morning .

Was in and out or office in ten minutes .
Attendent was nice and thorough .
The right parts , At the right time ...
I must say I normally don't by parts online , because you never know what you are going to get .
But I'm thankful I did .
I got the right part in a timely manner , And the price bet any other part place around my location .....
PartsGeek you got me as a customer ....

From start to finish a great shopping experience
I love the website it 's beautiful , I enjoying looking at all the products in a leisurely manner .
I ordered some soaps for holiday gifts , the order was shipping quickly and packed well .
I will shop again at Seven Colonial and I will tell my friends .
A real time-saving service
I ordered the best food for my dog and set up a schedule for delivery .
Pet Flow emails you a few days before each shipment and you if you have enough food for a while , you can cancel or postpone the delivery .
This is a worry free way to get your pet food regularly .
Quick process , received generous payment
I wasn't sure I'd receive the quoted amount as I had some small scratches on my phone , however I was paid the full amount of money predicted .
One Dollar Mall could it really be ?
I love this site .
I ordered some shirts from here and I found there service to easy and fast .

The quality was absolutely amazing .
I would definitely recommend this site to s friend .

Romance in full Bloom
She loved the two dozen roses , said they were gorgeous !!!!
I'm extremely pleased
Would I use GAK again ?
You bet I would .
The service and the courtesy with which my order was processed was exemplary .
If ever GAK pull out of the music business they could make a fortune training some bigger privatised companies in how to deal properly with their customers !
Full marks !
Excellent customer service
The ordering was simple over the telephone , friendly and helpful .
The delivery to a second floor flat without a lift was the next day and delvered by efficient and friendly guys .
Will defiantly use again
Nice Prices , nice customer service , nice brands
Fantastic selection of brands ( even if it´s an Outlet) , very good quality - a real German quality- and the prices are unbeatable !
Right , a delivery from the continent may take a little bit but it is always worth waiting !
Dress for less also give you a voucher to sign up for their newsletter , so I was able to save a few money .
I was really pleased with the service ( a very efficient customer service ) and would definately shop there again .
one of a kind
Part was exactly as described and packaged in a secure way to prevent damage .
One of a kind company that delivers what they say .....
Easy ordering .

If you cannot find the item you need there are people to assist you , either by phone or email .

Always check .
You can go back and correct it .
Otherwise , a great company with service after the sale .
I have purchased from them for years .
Always a good experience .
Pretty good over all !
Ordered a alien helmet .
Got here ( USA ) in 7 days .

Cheap prices , and reliable .
Had the exact room I needed at the exact dates .
Definately saved alot of money
Easy and affordable .
BH has great customer and the easiest navigational website I have used .
The part worked perfect and quick delivery !!
Couldn't ask for a better experience and the price was right !
I will definitely use PartsGeek again !
I've ordered parts from partsgeek on several occasions .
Never had an issue with the parts received ; partsgeek provide order status and tracking info in short order .
Partsgeek is my first stop when shopping online for car parts .
Will look elsewhere before purchasing from Parts Geek again .
Ordered a rebuilt alternator and received the incorrect item not to mention the item that did show up had broken plastic clips and back cover that were obviously painted as to not draw attention to them .
The worst part of the whole thing is me waiting ( without a car ) for a week to receive the wrong part .
The only plus I'll give these guys is they did allow me to return it ; however , that was a long and drawn out process that ended up costing me even more money as I had to pay for shipping of the wrong part TWICE .
Very efficient service
Company recommended to me by a friend . My first expereince of dealing with them but will certainly use them again .
Very pleased with speed of delivery and quality of communication
I always like doing business with B&H , thorough & professional
The employees are knowledgeable and very agreeable .
A smooth trip overall .
This time the hours and delays were reasonable , and I was able to negotiate my moves from on station to another .
The price was very , very good .
Not only did i find my daughters text book at the lowest price anyone whose been to college could ever dream , they shipped it super fast .
I couldn't ask for anything better !
Very fast shipping and price was the best out there !
Would recommend to others in the market for OEM wheels for their vehicle .
No problems with order and prompt delivery .
With such low prices , I wasn't really expecting good quality , so I was pleasantly surprised when my order arrived .
I have no reservations about shopping at ModDeals again .
Good company , a few days delay in delivery but products such as the description !
Great efficient service
website easy to navigate , best pricing I could find , prompt delivery .
I will certainly use Hot Toner again
Extremely inaccurate delivery times
I have just asked Philipsonwine to stop sending me any more advertisment mails .
I have also asked them to remove my account .
The reason : Of the last five deliveries four did not arrive until late in the afternoon the day after the promissed delivery time .
It is not very pleasent to wait for two full days before the wine arrives .
Amazingly Fast Service !
We ordered our part after 5:00 P.M. & paid extra for 1-day delivery .
Since it was after 5 , we did not expect the order to even be processed til the next day as stated on the website .
HOWEVER , we received the part the VERY next day before 9:30 a . m .
It shipped from Nashville , TN & we received it in metro Atlanta about 16 hours later .
We could hardly believe it !
It was a VW part and we do not have a VW dealership nearby .
To order through them , it would have taken 2 days to get it & the cost would have been sizably more .
EXTREMELY pleased !
Great Deal and great customer Service .
The manager there got me all set up very quickly and was very helpful .
He answered all my questions and I was very happy to be storing my stuff there !
your company are the best all around thank u
yes when i travel i allways talk about your company
Best Price on my Orders ...
I have ordered 3 times now and have received the best price on the items I've ordered with free , quick shipping .
Good expiration dates .
Everything arrived just fine .
I will order again !
Beautiful Dress !
This dress is beautiful !
Great quality , well made and the beading detail is absolutely gorgeous .
True to size .
don't know how partsgeek stays in business
I ordered a part from partsgeek a month ago .
I received it a week later .
They shipped me the wrong part .
I returned the part along with a photo of the right part - a rear bumper tow hook cover for my 2009 C300 .
I attached a printed brief letter explaining that I wanted the correct part shipped to me .
I received a refund for the part [$ 9.30 ] but not the overpriced shipping I paid which was $ 9.95 for a plastic part that weighs a few ounces .
My shipping should have been refunded too .
That plus the cost I paid to return the part .
Don't waste your time with partsgeek .
I don't even think they are a legitimate company .
I feel scammed .
Buyer beware .
excellent customer service
I ordered 3 objects , even though a specific part of one of these did not work .
I still rate 5 stars , and here 's why !
10min after sending an e-mail explaining what was wrong I received an answer
saying that a replacement part would be sent out the same day .
Great job and I'll be shopping here in the future
A good online RV parts resource
I have ordered several items from them now .
Recently there was a mix up on a the part ordered .
Dyer 's sales staff worked hard to correct the issue .
I was very impressed .
much needed Auto Parts
After shipping out part I did not know what Freight co . it was shipped through . could not track order , it arrived here just fine . Thanks for the great deal ( price)and will use your company when needed again .
The right part !
Easy as a breeze
Quick and easy ordering .
Easy to order supplies .. Delivery within a couple of days .
Used this website a few times and never a problem ...
Did not know what the truck was delivering .
Had no clue the truck was dropping off my order that quick .
Ordering was easy , it was a good experience all the way around .
I posted it on a coon dog site which is something I have never done for any other company .
great products , even better service !
I love mr chewy .
Even though it was my first order with them , I already know they are a great company .
I got my products in about 3 days !
And the shipping was free !
I was answered promptly and was very satisfied with the service provided .
Love the FREE items with every order
This is my 6th time ordering in a year and I brag to my wife showing her all the free items I received .
If you compare turn around time , prices and free items , Supplement Warehouse cant be beat .
Great selection - great price - great service !
Never used Barrington Sports before but wouldn't hesitate to use them again - their website is easy to use , the products I wanted were easy to find , and the prices competitive .
Delivery was prompt and everything was exactly as described .
I had no problems with order or delivery .
All went well as expected
Good service and experience , I would be happy to recommend this service to others .
No Problems Getting What I Wanted
Web site was good and clear , fast service and delivered in time for Christmas .
I love ServCorp for their great locations and their attentive staff .
I do think their prices are a bit higher than the competitors but if you are looking for a full quality service firm , then you may want to consider ServCorp
Took about fifteen minutes to get unlock code , came with easy instructions , unlock done in under a minute .
great and fast shipping !
Paet was a good price and arrived very quickly , I would recommend .
cheaper , mobile identification , super fast delivery
Very nice website .
I bought Diablo 3 about 10€ cheaper .
Key was delivered instantly after easy and fast mobile identification .
easy and affordable
Easy , affordable , made our mini vacation doable and fantastic .
Good but poor information before trip
Good experience once we got our tickets but the information prior was very poor .
We arrived at Victoria after searching the Internet about the place to collect tickets .
The website did not reveal anything .
We then were sent fr Victoria to the shop where we had to get into a long queue to collect tickets .
I was furious considering I had already bought my tickets .
The experience after this was good
Great Customer Service !
I will never go any where else to buy my filters .
I ordered the wrong size and they took care of me right away with no hassle !
Thanks Jim !
Very happy with my appliance .
It was the cheapsest price I could find .
I feel the extra insurance to cover the appliance is pushed too much though when I was purchasing the product on the phone I had to say no about 5/6 times that 's the only down fall .
Other than this very happy and speedy delivery .
Would buy again
good products supported by fast efficient service
Once you've got past the minor problem that items are listed by type and then by maker you will find a massive selection of top rate products .
Many are very difficult to find elsewhere .
If seach options allowing ranking by price and/or item specific values such as torch bulb output , knife blade length , lock or non lock folder etc were added then I could find no faults at all !
I have rated the company , service and store as 5 star , it 's only the web site I would rate as 4 star .
too many pens to fit in a high street shop !
I often have a difficulty with this site - temptation !
Whenever I start to browse I find something I want , sadly I've now more pens in my brefcase than I can write with on an everyday basis so some may dry up !
Seriously - I've always been satisfied by the service and products .
Excellent service , prompt shipping , quality products .
The agent helped me find the part I needed for my car .
The package arrived very soon , and the part works well in the car .
I have ordered from them several times .
what did you ship it in 5ft x 18 inch box .
The parts where ship in a box big enough for a person to stand in .
The parts order were a FLAT splash pan for a vw ., ( not rolled up )
Quality beats appearance
The grind plates are well made but the shoes ' color began wearing off immediately .
Speedy reliable service
Using lenstore is quick and easy and cheaper than getting lenses from the opticians
good part , BAD delivery
I ordered my part and everything look good from the time I got the tracking order to the time I never got the part .
Partsgeek used U.S.P.S and they can just drop it off even if no one is there , so they think .
I looked that after noon at my tracking number " Delivered ?
" No not Delivered stolen yes , live a box at your curb side mail box and no one at home what do you think is going to happen .
Did like how fast it got to my home .
Quick service and free shipping !
Life is good !
I have been ordering from pure formulas for several years .
I ahve always been pleased with their service and never had any problems .
Reasonable prices , free shipping and quick delivery .
What more could you want in a company ?
Couldn't find fault if I tried !
Great prices and super quick delivery .
We ordered about 2pm and they were through our door the next morning .
Excellent service .
Quick and easy to use website .
Delivered as promised .
Toasty bathroom , toasty feet !
The underfloor heating was very easy to install .
The controls are very easy to use to ensure the floor is always at the perfect temperature at the perfect time .
It completes the bathroom and the kids love lying down to warm themselves up !
Worth the wait
the sunglasses I ordered had to be back ordered - I loved how the customer support team gave me the option to wait or get a refund ...
I decided to wait .
the customer support team continued to keep me up to date with how my order was progressing and then finally , my new sunglasses arrived !
the wait didn't seem nearly as bad due to the regular updates from the customer support team .
first class performance
excellent service and was shocked at how quick my order arrived , was kept up to date via email as to exactly where my order was and when it would be delivered .
will be using from now on .
cancelled my transaction when i realised my error - no problem !!
when I realised I had picked wrong service for my transaction I called up and asked if I could cancel , no problem , very polite and helpful , instant refund !
Top banana !

Fast , Accurate , Inexpensive Transcription - What Else Could You Ask For !
Full Scale Productions interviews a lot of people in our filming process .

YOU HAVE MADE A LIFETIME CUSTOMER
I GOT AN OLDER PRINTER FROM MY DAUGHTER THAT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR SIME TIME .
I KNEW THE INK WOULD BE DRIED UP SO I ORDER INK FROM YOU WEB SITE .
THEN I TRIED TO LOAD THE PRINTER SOFTWARE ON MY COMPUTER AND FOUND OUT THAT THE PRINTER WAS NOT COMPATABLE WITH WINDOWS 7 .
IT HAD ONLY BEEN A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR SINCE I BOUGHT THE INK SO I CALLED YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CANCEL MY ORDER .
THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE ORDER WAS ALREADY PULLED BY THE WAREHOUSE BUT HE WOULD ISSUE A CREDIT AND TRY TO STOP THE ORDER .
HE SAID IF I RECEIVE THE INK JUST RETURN IT .
I RECEIVED THE CREDIT IMMEDIATLY AND I RECEIVED THE INK A FEW DAYS LATER .
I RETURNED THE INK AND HAVE SINCE BOUGHT A NEW PRINTER .
INKFARM WILL GET ALL OF MY FUTURE ORDERS .
THANKS FOR THE GREAT CUSOMER SERVICE .
Great , punctual service and an excellent product .
Great , punctual service and an excellent product .
Cutting edge on fitness & health -- I absolutely love it !
Onnit goes above & beyond when it comes to their dedication and commitment to fitness & health - for the mind , body , & soul .
I recommend their products to anyone interested in stepping up their game .
One of the best decisions of our weekend !
We are so pleased that we did this as we never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes for our next bus .
Great weather meant we were up on the top most of the time and the view is so much better up there as well .
All stops located exactly where you would hope to find them .
Clean buses and great commentary as well - well worth the cost and would definitely use again - thanks !
2007 Honda accord drivers mirror
I do a lot of small jobs like mirrors and have gotten them from other places .
I saw an add for the geek and said why not ?
So I ordered it and it came quick and in good cond .
The price and shipping was very good .
The mirror went together good and the girl had the original color cover was in good shape and I reused it so that was good .
I hope to get more from the Geek next time I need parts .
I live in a good area for getting anything you ever need , but I like the fact that I don't have to deal with traffic and save money !
The grill band was in great shape and was simple to install .
This grill band arrived in great shape and was simple to install .
It looks good and makes the vehicle look so much better .
The price was good and I am happy with the results .
Really good service , very efficient & responded quickly to confirm the booking .
Would definitely use again , the company were very good at letting me know when they would be arriving and the cost was the same as a larger rival benefit with the benefit of the convenience of Event Tyres coming to my work place .
Suburban Furnace Warms us on Our Latest Camping Trip !
It did take a protracted period of time to receive the furnace from American RV but it was reasonably easy to install it .
This past weekend we went to Ringing Rocks Family Campground at Upper Black Eddy , PA .
The weather was in the lower 40 's at night but our newly installed Suburban Furnace kept us nicely toasty warm .
Great pencils , very hard to find

Speedy service & very efficient
An amazing site with great selection , terrific prices , and a wonderful staff .
As a guy I've never really been into shopping .
Thankfully I found YesStyle and they have really helped my wardrobe tremendously .
Every experience with them so far has been great .
Even before my first order I emailed customer service with a question and they responded very quickly .
I'm really impressed with everything and can't say enough good things about the site .
Great prices , products , and customer service !
I had a couple issues with a gift card that was given to me at christmas .
I had been in communication via email with one of the members of customer service .
With a quick call and some resolution , I was issued a new gift card and able to process my transaction with ease .
I was especially appreciative because I am moving out of the country and the way in which the problem had been expedited was greatly appreciated !
Great car rental experience , hassle free !
From arriving at the rental desk to being in the car on my way was 15 mins tops , I guess lucky no queue but from the time I got to the desk it was very easy , not the first time I've used Alamo and won't be my last .
The parts I ordered were just as good if not better than O . E . M .
at 25% of the cost and would highly recommend Parts Geek to anyone !
Couldn't ask for better service .
While a very small order , my job was given every possible curtosy and consideration .
From the time I placed my order til receipt , a total of 5 days had elapsed .
The results are precisely what I expected .
No complaints , no reservations what so ever .
Order in confidence .
Great place to order parts from ...
Received the correct parts I ordered .
Very happy with what I ordered .
Easy site to use , thanks geek ...
Unique fashion that 's affordable !
This company has some of the most original clothing I've seen .
I almost purchased a khaki jacket at Forever21 , but found a much cooler one here .
Love the free shipping to U.S. as well !
Unbelievable Scam people don't know about .
What people do not know is that even though a flight may have 100 empty seats , Travelocity will lead you to believe there are no two seats together , so if you want to sit next to your mate , you have to pay a premium for the seating , only to get on the plane and find out it is empty .
This happened to me coming and going on a recent flight .
Seating was assigned through travelocity , but they showed the plane nearly full so I put out the cash to book that last remaining seats together .
The plane was actually so empty , staff advised the passengers they could sit anywhere .
This creates the foundation for a class action law suit .
Word to the wise , check before you buy .
Unless you are willing to wait without any word for weeks you shouldn't use the site !
The Order was made on 7 May and it took until 21 May for the order to be shipped !
I didn't get everything I ordered and NO reason Why !
I was not notified why there was a delay in the first place .
Nothing has been said about the missing items .
I do not know whether they may still becoming or I should forget about it !
Same reliable service as always
Rented a car .
Transaction went well .
What more is there to say ?
Their service was a " photo finish "
I ordered what I consider to be an expensive , for me , camera accessory .
I looked numerous other places ( on-line and off ) for this particular item and found DigitalRev to be the best price and included " free shipping ( always a plus for me) .
After placing the order , I noticed that my order was being processed and was on its way within the not-quite-promised 24 hour period .
I received the order packed within a very , very tough plastic bag , and my accessories wrapped inside enough protective material to protect the most delicate of contents .
As I hoped , my camera accessories came out of the shipping bag as if it was handed to me by a white-gloved specialist .
I would never hesitate to make another purchase .
A real " photo finish "!
Wonderful experience !
I normally do not shop on-line so it was a fantastic experience .
I was provided with the confirmation of the order so I knew actually what was going on .
The delivery was quick .
I received my new jacket in a few days .
Thank you so much !
Simply perfect !
Rapidity , Professionalism , and Kindness .
My order was very urgent and they were able to anticipate delivery of my custom print order respect the announced delivery time , processing it immediatly .
They also proposed me better solutions for same price .
I would indeed recommend this company to anyone .
great , quick and well explained
great , quick and well explained
Comprehensive , clear , quick and easy
I was recommended the site by a friend originally .
I went ahead and made a large initial order which came through in two days , all correct and together .
I received emails keeping me updated on the shipping .
And because I'm always buying for two , delivery is free .
So far I've found nothing to fault with this site , and will be continuing to use it monthly
Would use them again
Perfect , can't complain !
Every step went well and I love my new sofa set .
Recomended 100% !!!
Would buy again
Great tasting wine .
No after taste .
Great service from seller .
Fast delivery .
What a superb experience , the service was fast and the quality is excellent .
Tomorrow I needed these documents for a visit to U.S.C.I.S. , and my order was sent on Monday .
Within hours my order was finished and now I am ready to go with my certified translation to the Embassy .
Thank you Language Oasis !
Outstanding for computers suppiles and peripherials !
I have been a customer of Altex now for quite a number of years .
They have helped me to hand build my last 4 very powerful computer systems without digging into my pocket more than necessary from towers , to power supplies , mother boards , graphic cards and other accessories .
The last system I built from their stock has lasted over 5 years now and is still running like a champ even though it gets quite a bit of high demand on a daily basis .
I am lucky enough to live by their real life brick and mortar home base shop in San Antonio , Texas and I get weak in the knees every time I go there from seeing how much stock and the new items they obtain for sale .!
( I am such a girl geek) , LOL
I have even had them work and clean some of my computers and they have always done exactly what was needed and not any more than I requested .
Their computer staff and tech people definitely know what they are doing .
When I don't feel like driving to their main headquarters store , I can easily order what I need from their online store .
They usually have everything any electronic or computer geek needs !
Check them out !
You'll be very happy , I always am !
You won't be blue hosting with Bluehost !
I had wandered the internet looking for a great host at good pricing , after reading a few forums online about hosting sites , I kept reading so many good things about BlueHost that I decided to finally commit to them .
I was never disappointed once with any of their service or addon services such as a dedicated security for my shopping cart .
With Bluehost , I found it very easy to use their cPanel for maintaining my website .
Working with databases , MySql and more was simple to learn and straight forward .
BlueHosts support staff was quicker than other hosting sites that I had tried in the past to send me help or answer any questions I had .
The perfect online shop for great clothing for all sizes including larger women !
I would give Womanwithin 10 stars if it were possible .
I have shopped at this site for over a year now .
The clothes and comfortable , attractive and reasonably priced .
Womanwithin even allows returns if your unhappy a purchase for any reason .
I wear larger sized clothes because I love loose fitting clothing and to the often dismay of my husband ( who pays the bill ) I constantly find way too much to buy at Womanwithin !
They even have clothing accessories , jewelry and SHOES !!!!
If you want reasonable priced , comfortable clothing in your perfect size make it a point to visit the site .
You can even apply for a Womanwithin credit card !
( again , My poor husband , LOL ) Their credit card is also accepted by 4 or 5 other clothing sites online , like Romans .
Womanwithin even has a clearance section that gets changed out quite often too !
Visit Womanwithin . com and look around , you will not be disappointed !
World Market always has such unique items in stock !
I love shopping at World Market online and even in their real life brick and mortar stores .
It 's a large emporium full of delightful items , some items are quite unique and come from far away places handmade by craftsmen in distant lands .
There are beautiful dishes and wonderful kitchen and cooking supplies .
Exotic clothes and jewelry , bedding , lamps , soaps and toiletries , all kinds of glass wares , toy , wall decor , curtains and umbrellas and the food , teas and coffees come from the world over !
I will also mention that with any holiday on your calendar , you can bet World Market will be fully stocked with items you would have a difficult time finding anywhere else !
I gave it 4 stars !
I honestly had to deduct one star only because some of the imported items prices can be a bit costly ( at least on my tight budget ) but then , you have to realize how far they go to obtain may of their items and how unique many of the items are .
All in all , World Market is a wonderful store !
Consumer Rankings , a quality resource for your web presence !
Choosing the best options for hosting your personal or business presence on the internet can be one of the most important things you commit to on the web .
Paying for bad hosting can mean life or death for your business .
You could wind up with your customers having to deal with a slow loading web site or they might even face a completely dead web from exceeding bandwidth restrictions , the same goes for your personal web site as well .
You need the necessary information and tools to make a quality judgment on which company you are going to elect to host your site .
Consumer Rankings is an excellent resource to discover your best choice to decide on which hosting company your going to trust for up time , bandwidth and pricing and much more .
AWESOME SHOES , FEEL GREAT IN MY TOES .
WAIT FOR THE SALES , YOU WON'T BELIEVE THE PRICES .
THE SHOES LOOK GREAT FOR THE PRICES .
WHY SPEND $200 ON THESAME SHOES YOU CAN BUY FOR $ 39.99 AT AMICLUBWEAR .
I LOVE THIS SITE , FOR SHOES !!!!!!!!!!
Horrible customer service
I loved shoes period .
When I placed my first order , I was hesitant it took 7 days to arrived which I anticipated because its a free shipping .
On my next order , when it arrives the box was shanked & did not received the complete order so I called , customer service cant get hold of anyone .
phone lines are busy I kept getting the recording .
I sent an email to the support department did not received a reply .
After 2 weeks I called again , I spoke w/ a rep told her I did not get my other shoe & yet the receipt indicated that its out but they will be shipping it to separately .
i waited for a week & yet no refund received or tracking # so i called back i finally spoke to a live person after an hour of holding so she apologized to me but its after 2 weeks .. I did received my refund 2 days after .... sometimes you get what you paid for ...
I felt this parking area was very secure .
I felt this parking was very secure .
Quality , Delivery , Service , not something you usually expect online , this company is however an exception to the rule !
Professional outfit , the item purchased was well priced , the delivery from placement of order was excellent and they even e-mailed me to check against fraud as I was out of the country then I placed the order .
I have since received the item , again I was impressed as my item was noticeable well packaged , and truthfully I even commented on the level of the packaging to a colleague .
Online shopping can be a little hit and miss in my experience , this company can however be assured of my business in future should I have a similar requirement .
I am in Mexico and tried to get a part shipped to a friend who could send it to me ( I am broken down and the part is not sold here) .
After shipment was refused the first time I tried to get a non 800 number to call and talk to them , I sent 4 emails and they never gave me a number .
Finally my purchase was refused supposedly because they do not accept foreign credit cards .
I WAS USING AN AMERICAN CREDIT CARD FOR THE PURCHASE .
I guess I am going to have to go make the trip myself to the US to buy the part need
surprisingly clean and in good shape for the price .
Paid $54 per night .
Excellent deal .
Walking distance from convention center .
Close to universal and sea world .
And only 15 minutes to airport .
Will stay here again .
Staff is awesome !
Flowers are always beautiful !
Great company to do business with !
Recommended seller - Goods arrived as requested and well packed .

Grey winter days are OK
Alaska Northern light box is one of the best made boxes on the market .
I have my light box on my desk and turn it on every morning .
I did have a few questions when I first got my light box and their customer service was great !
I have told many friends to purchase this light box and I know several have and LOVE IT !

The Best One-Stop Shop for Shades
I stumbled upon Giant Vintage online a few years back .
Their eclectic selection quickly caught my eye .
Since then they have nearly tripled their inventory .
The site is easy to use , with categories that make shopping a breeze .
The prices are reasonable and they offer more than just vintage glasses .
The glasses themselves are well made , not flimsy " nice- looking " pieces .
And they ship fast , my last package came in just 3 business days .
Each package comes standard with fluff to ensure a safe journey and a few Tootsie Rolls as their signature touch .
All in all Giant Vintage is a wonderful online store with an almost endless selection .
Everyone is bound to find a great pair here .
Excellent Service , I was very pleased at how fast the part came in for my car .
My main fear of buying on line is if the product becomes faulty after a little while .
Unfortunately mine did several months after purchase .
The service I received was brilliant , no fuss even collected from my home by courier and all sorted in a meter of days .
Will I but from shop to again ?
You bet I will
Super sprawa , szybka przesylka , towar zgodny z fotkami , ladnie zapakowany .
Jedynie brak niestety fotek podeszwy na stronie , ale i tak kupie u nich ponownie .
Quick delivery , nice packaging , colour and style as on pics on website , 1 thing to improve is that there should be pics of the sole of shoes as I wouldnt buy one pair if I knew how the sole looks like .
But overall reception is fantastic and I won't hesitate to buy again .
Excellent price & delivery speed
Can't fault this order from start to finish
Don't bother looking anywhere else !
Excellent advice given and perfect replacement shower received & fitted .
Good price and prompt delivery .
Website accepted a handful of CDs for trade in , totalling £ 7.49 .
Nine days later I receive a PDF voucher for 60p .
I emailed , asking for an explanation .
No response .
Five days later , most of my CDs turn up again .
Again , no explanation , and three of them now have half-torn stickers on the cases .
Again , I complained , and after chasing again , received a stock reply which claimed most of the CDs were too scratched .
The stickers were due to them being labelled , then having them removed .
Frankly , this is utter rot .
First , the CDs were obviously used but far from ' too heavily scratched'.
In some cases , they were near-mint .
This is doubly dubious , given the poor condition of stock I have purchased from the shop .
As far as the stickers go , CeX shouldn't have labelled the stock - which it didn't own - until it has accepted it .
As such , it was seemingly too much effort for the staff member to remove properly , each leaving the backing half ripped and stuck to the cases .
Overall , CEX wasted my time , didn't check the CDs carefully , failed to notify me , then , when challenged three times , fabricated excuses to cover themselves .
None of this is satisfactory and , overall , CeX continues to offer a poor service that I shall never use again .
Very good experience all round .
Pre-order stayed in place ; lower price honoured ; delivered a day early , within its one-hour slot .
Didn't get to check if the driver was called Steve but I can live without knowing that .
Best rate hassle free check in
This is the first time i used this service .
Easytobook is very convenient to use .
They offer the lowest rates .
Check in is hassle free .
Customer service is good because if you have any queries they will respond right away .
I will definitely use easy to book again .
Item shipped immediately , very satisfied .
Very happy with price of part & the prompt shipping .
Quick , Easy , Hassle Free
I recently sold three water damaged ( irreparable ) phones to Mazuma Mobile .
The phones would have otherwise been thrown in the rubbish bin , so to receive a $ 50.00 cheque in the mail was worthwhile .
The whole transaction was processed quickly and easily .
Mazuma posted me a self-addressed envelope so I didn't have to pay for any postage costs .
The whole thing was processed within a week .
Great quality for price
Always find what I am looking for and more often than not quick delivery times and emails that always keep me up to date .
Paypal makes my life easier !
I love paypal , quick simple and straight forward .

Totally satisfied with their service
I have ordered two parts for different cars .
Parts came in quickly with no problems and I'm 100% satisfied , especially with the cost .
I ordered a window switch assembly for a 2000 Grand Am , dealer wanted $159 , Partsgeek cost about $50 .
Awesome deal .
Would recommend them to anyone that wants to save $$$$ .
Great service , fast shipping , excellent product !
I cannot explain enough how great the service was .
Stethoscope shipped same day as ordered ( engraved too !
) and at my door in three days .
I'm on the west coast so I was surprised it was so fast .
I couldn't be happier and will order from the company again !
Very good idea
I try Wimdu until now one time , just good idea if you want to save some money and meet new people

Some awesome deals
It was a great shopping experience for my first order .
I liked the prices at Pet Flow and the items were exactly as described .
The princess pet bed is great for my diva Yorkie and I like the light for her collar .
I bought four so I could them for my son 's dogs too .
The purchases arrived very quickly .
Brilliant service and super fast payment !
So simple to use , envelope came in the post with full instructions , posted my phones the next day .
Couldn't have been easier .

I am very pleased with customer service and clarity in connection
Excellent service and very good value .
I have no hesitation in recommending this company to anyone .
The product was very good value and the delivery service was excellent .

Great Service , fast
Felt " Shroom Tech 's " effects with very first workout .
Stronger , more energy without the " stimulant " fell .
Great Product .
Im a DJ/Karaoke host , I lost my screen , and ordered the new one from you guys .
You were fast and efficient , I got my screen installed and was back in the game before anyone noticed .
The site was so easy to use and the choices of facilities saved me hours of time .
I was referred to the site by my son’s school .
I was very impressed with the number of facilities that were listed in the area were goes to school and the transparent pricing .
As soon as I booked the location ans size I wanted , my phone rang and it was someone from the storage location that I had decided on confirming the details .
It was lightning quick .
I felt great after he confirmed the details and pricing for me .
It was a great experience .
so easy even my wife could use it
I love the site .
The ordering is easy and the product depth is amazing .
We order from them monthly since it only takes a day or three for the order to arrive , and the delivery is FREE .
I have recommended this site to my friends and they tell me that they love it too .
The fastest , easiest way to order supplements .
Supplement Warehouse is by far the best website to order health and workout supplements from .
They have the best prices , with decent shipping costs .
Tons of deals and free samples , and your order arrives fast .
Five out of five stars .
Love the product not the shipping price so much
Bottles do just what I need .. the price is right ... but the Shipping cost really drives up the price per piece ..
I must admit I am looking for cheaper options .
Just for the cost of shipping .
No fuss , fast delivery and i like how they remind you when you need to order more lenses .
I know that whenever I'm in need of new camera equipment , B&H will not only have the best in stock , but will have knowledgable associates ready to help in the live chat .
I've always felt confident with my purchases , and have had no regrets !
Thanks B&H !
Very good customer service
We ordered frames and posters and were very happy with the speed of the order arriving and the after-sales service .
Extremely fast response to queries and very helpful .
Love 4 wheel Drive Hardware
Love what you bring to the table with all the cool and functional parts we need to keep our Jeeps going .
Your catalogs are great , and your customer service is outstanding .
I am in the customer service business so i can speak with 35 years of customer service experience .
Your web site and trying to find parts on the web site leave a lot to be desired , all though i have noticed it has gotten a little better over the last couple years .
That is why i rely on your catalogs and customer service they can always find the part i am looking for and are very friendly about helping .
It is awesome that you have a lot of free shipping now that makes it so much more enticing ( financially) .
I do wish you had a store closer to Central Mich that i could pick things up from , but until that happens keep up the great Jeep business you have and thanks for all .
I have ordered most of my Jeep parts from 4WDH and have been a Jeep customer for about 24 years and still Love my Jeeps .
Great service as always ...
Please put a note on web site that a size smaller thankyou
Items received quickly and as requested .
Would use again .
Dependable and trustworthy .
I have come to trust their competitive prices and reliable service .
great product , great company , great results .....

They sent the bag quickly and put the money in account quickly
Very good service i'm very happy with my PC .
My pc arrived in very good time and is working great .
Exactly what i wanted .
first time shopping , complet satisfaction ... quick delivery ... great , thanks
Freight Pros quickly understood my shipping need and handled the shipment professionally .
The actual carrier did drop the ball by not calling me before pick up though .
I would recommend Freight Pros and Evan to anyone needing LTL service .
Thanks Wyatt Logan ....
Can't find a better service .
Square trade personal are very professional and my warranty was covered in less than 2 days .
Great service .
If you want it for the outdoors they got at a good price !
I have ordered many items from Greenman Bushcraft from clothing to knives and have never been disappointed , great quality kit at good prices !
See it , order it , get it !
Great quick delivery service , if the haven't it in stock they keep you in the loop and sen it as soon as they have it .. they live by the old methods ie customer satisfaction means repeat custom ... good on them
All was good , except this was supposed to be anonymous .
Was trying to find a way to anonymously send money to a friend in need .
The instructions said it would be anonymous if I didn't put my name in one of the fields , which I didn't.
Didn't work .
The person knew right away it was from me .
Thank you ! Great to have business with , quick delivery and great communication .
I will shop in your store again .
really fast and good prices .
advice for the courtesy and quality .
not believe the negative views .
Everything from start to finish was good .
I ordered a ring and the staff called me and emailed the ring before they ship which was great because I could have chosen the wrong ring and they showed me a better one which I got .
Great service all around .
Great Products , great service
I loved the variety of darling and useful LED keychain lights at this site , plus there was a wonderful information sheet explaining where the different colors are most effective .
Very happy with my purchases .
Our designer was friendly and efficient all plans sent via email .
Quality of cabinets is excellent and the delivery people were amazing .
Would recommend to everyone .
Wren has the best customer service I have come across .
Amazing , Fantastic
Placed my order on Christmas Eve and the parcel arrived day ofater Boxing Day .
Beautifully packaged with the added bonus of chocolates .
Can't believe how amazing the service was , how reasonable the delivery charge was and overall wonderful ease of the transaction .
Shipped next day , delivered shortly after , online does them no justice , It look like I paid hundreds for the labels !
Makes life easy when living abroad
Quick service well priced .
One downside can't buy in France exactly what I can buy in UK but great to be able to get all my pet supplies online
Very nice card and value
I like the idea of making my own card and able to personalize the card .
The cost of the card was reasonable .
Excellent Product and Service
I have never written a review for any product before , but I want any prospective buyers to know I was so impressed with the Juicer I bought and the excellent customer service I recieved when I contacted them with a query .
It was delivered promptly and with a free recipe book .
I'm very glad I chose this company to buy from
Two delivery charges for one package
I ordered 2 sets of plectrums ( 14 in total ) for which I was charged 2 delivery charges .
One for each set .
The plectrums would have fitted into a small jiffy bag , instead they were dispatched as one order in a small bag inside a box approximatly 12 inches square which had then been filled with packing .
love this website !
Have bought gift cards from this website multiple times .
quick and safe .
Trustworthy , best prices around !!
Bookbyte is better than any other online textbook search engine I have used .
Normal I spend 100 - 200 dollars depending on the book but I was able to find a used but in good condition textbook for less than $40 !
And that included shipping !
I will be using Bookbyte again !
Fast and reliable .
Was hoping to pick up a BF4 key before the weekend , and I received a region-unlocked key in 2 minutes !
The key unlocked successfully .
With so many key sites out there now , I can say that this one delivers .
Good prices as well .
With long stand by and conversation times to meet your specific needs , these headsets provide high quality sound streaming and original stereo tracks .
This pair of low price and comfortable to wear headset can be linked to two phones simultaneously .
You can now look forward to a crystal clear sound transmission which does not clash with any ambient noises and keep your conversations smooth and audible .
Got the wrong part but cost to much to return it .
Don't like the 15% restock fee .
Ordered a tail light assembly for my 97 Ford pickup and the box said 97 ford but the light didn't fit .
If I sent it back , afther freight and restocking charge I would have got about $ 2.00 back
Quick and Easy !
My dog was put on a seafood diet .
I had a hard time finding it in the local stores , so I ordered it and it came so quickly ... only 2 or 3 days , so I had it on hand right away .
Good service .
Love 10dollar mall .
all the items I have ordered have been delivered fast and are of good quality .
Never had a need to return any items but the 365 day return policy is great
Always great service
Ive been buying from shopto.net for a number of years now and personally I've never had a problem .
My latest order did however have a hickup but it was quickly sorted by myself and the shopto staff who were more than helpful in rectifying the error from their end .
With that aside shopto.net is always the first website I look at when purchasing games on any platform .
The prices are always low , the 5 minute dispatch is a awesome touch .
And They also stock games other retailers/etailers don't, including special/collectors editions .
Just check it out :)
Africa Odyssey – Dream team for a dream holiday or honeymoon
The team at Africa Odyssey helped us arrange an incredible safari and beach adventure in Tanzania for our honeymoon .
This was our first trip to East Africa , and coming from the U.S. we were a little cautious booking with an overseas travel agency .
After speaking to a number of providers , Africa Odyssey stood out for its depth of knowledge in Tanzania and its great customer service .
Tom worked patiently to educate us on our options .
He listened to our preferences / concerns and then provided excellent recommendations .
As we worked to finalize our itinerary , Tom made sure that we had all of the details that we could possibly need to make an informed decision .
During the trip , we were impressed by the high level of attention to detail at all points .
The accommodations were exactly as described , and yet they still managed to surprise us and exceed our expectations .
The safari lodges and beach resort rolled out the red carpet to create lasting honeymoon memories .
The transfers were handled smoothly and professionally .
Africa Odyssey’s interest in our feedback post-trip ( including which animals we spotted ) demonstrates their keen interest in staying informed about the properties and itineraries they plan to ensure the best possible experience for their clients .
Africa Odyssey planned a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us , and we look forward to returning to them for help booking our next adventure on the continent .
I Love this website !!!
This site is so great , they have great specials and sales .
I also love that it only takes a few days to get your order .
And they offer a very wide variety of products at very reasonable prices .
Try them out I promise you won't regret it .
I would give them 20 stars if I could .
90% find rate meanin i find 90% percent of what im looking for
very little hassle
Never have a problem
Extremely slow shipping .
My experienc with pure health was overall pleasant , but when called the phone number provided no on answered , and the shipping took 20 days .
Just Another Good Review
I've bought from B&H many times over the years .
Prices and selection are very good with prompt shipping .
Never needed customer service so I can't vouch for that .
No worries buying here .
Competitve prices , lowest min postage $ .
and quick delivery
West Coast Shaving is an awesome e-retail site for wet-shavers .
Competive prices , lower than most by far >
And low first class postage for small light weight items like shave brushes and razor blades .
A very memorable journey and wonderful experiences in Peru .
A very well organized tour package ........ Clara of SouthAmerica , Travel did a good job in arranging for our adventure of Peru .
Flights , Pick up from airports and hotels and other transportation arrangements , clean and safe hotels with courteous staff and most of all the English speaking guides made our journey to Peru a smooth sailing one .
Our visit to Macchu Picchu was the highlight of that journey and indeed the ruins were very beautiful .
We were blessed with favorable weather while we were in Macchu Picchu and our 1st class accommodation in the train was a very memorable experience .
I would like to commend SouthAmerica . Travel . com for a job well done .
Great range , good value , trusted speedy delivery
Time and time again merlin deliver on price and delivery .
When I need a part to get here quick .
They are who I use .
Certain items I order take a full 10 days to get from coast to coast .
I have tested this theory 4 times .
So if u want some items fast , perhaps shop around .
Absolute FIVE star service in all respects !
Superb service from Merlin Cycles .
Used several times over the past month and each transaction has been faultless with super fast delivery .
Most importantly for me these guys use the Royal Mail for their deliveries which is most important as we both work full time and are never here to receive the parcels .
The RM service allows collection from the local post office rather than travelling many miles to collect from other couriers .
Keep it up guys !
pleasant buying experience
I'd recomend this company to anyone .
They were helpful , friendly , fast service and most of all good price .
Love dealing with this company .
They'll stand by their products and assist you with any issues .
Will never carry my clubs again !
Don't know why I waited so long to use this service , schlepping clubs around is a real pain .
Door to door service is the way to go !
Can't wait for my next trip !
Fast , prompt service with my internet order on Pendleton blanket !
Blanket arrive 5 days after ordering !
It was well packaged and exactly what I wanted .
Vet medic not a headache to deal with .
Hi ... just want to tell you about vet medic which i used the other day ... i would highly recommend them .... good service and delivery and would gladly use them again .
Goldstar is a winner !
Goldstar is my go-to place when I am looking for something fun and different to do .
It is a dependable , easy site for purchasing all types of entertainment tickets .
My friends are constantly asking .
" Have you seen it yet on Goldstar ?
" And I am saying , " Yes , I will get the tickets .
" I recommend it to everyone , even people I don't know , when I am sitting next to them at an event I have saved money on from Goldstar .
Keep up the good work and keep expanding your available events .
A GOLD star for Goldstar !
A great way to see and do many different things that I would probably not choose to do at full price .
We recently rented a storage unit from Public Storage as we downsized from a house to an apartment .
With many years of accumulation of personal property , it was impossible to fit everything into the apartment .
Thankfully , we can utilize our storage unit and access our belongings at our convenience .
Convenient but sometimes too many choices difficult to decide .
Good to find hotel through agoda.com , makes thing convenient for you but you will spoilt with choices and will take long time to decide .
I wish the commentaries should include the hotel response .
For example , if someone complains about bad air-conditioning , hotel needs to response .
If they don't, this confirms the lousy commitment to serving its customers .
Quick and easy reservation process - Best price available
Excellent process and easiest for multiple car bookings - Will be back .
Never call customer service , you will connect to India and you'll regret it .
I made a reservation for the wrong dates .
I knew I would have to pay to reschedule because I made an error .
When I called to reschedule I talked to some lady I could not understand , and she didn't understand me , she booked my trip for wrong dates .
I called back within a hour when I got the confirmation email , but they charged me an additional $200 .
They said I had to wait for them to listen to recording of transaction .
I have called them several times since Dec . 24 , 2013 to no avail .
I think they will just keep my money , I will never use this service again and I hope everyone needs my warning !!!!!!
I started off paying $ 342.00 but because of an date error paid $ 485.900 additional .
My trip cost $ 827.00 ..
The poor get poorer !!!!
Received wrong part .
Cannot get in touch with customer service .
Called and been on hold for 30 minutes without ever talking to anyone .
Sent email no reply
Absolutely unacceptable experience
Good price and good delivery
Good service and would but from them again .
It was awsome how fast they got me what I ordered .
The whole experience with ordering my kilt was fast and easy .
I never had a problem and the delivery was fast it only took a couple of weeks .
I've had problems in the past with other sites taking 6-8 weeks before i got what i ordered .
This was amazing service .
Everything went very well .
I will certainly use them again
Saved my ass in Thailand !
I bought a phone of craigslist , and the person lied to me about it being unlocked and jailbroken .
The OS was version 6 , and I was basically screwed in a foreign country with a brick .
These guys saved me !
Oh , my phone was fixed BEFORE I got the email .
Don't wait for the email to see if your phone is unlocked .
Excellent service , you get what is promised .
Excellent service , you get what is promised .
Everything perfect , no surprise :)
Easy , clear , and sure !
Overall a great shopping on line experince
Fast and efficient I can't fault delivery arrangement s.I coud not get my first choice of items as they were out of stock otherwise a good shopping exerience
unresponsive customer service
Several calls to customer service .
4or 5 with no explanation of why order was not shipped .
No tracking available .. very frustrating experience
Good product , Good service , Good price
Purchased fog lamps for 2010 Town and Country which seem to be extremely hard to find .
These appear to be of equal quality to the originals but I just installed the part so don't have an opinion on longevity .
It would have helped immensely if they would have included an install instruction sheet with them as it is readily apparent how to get the old lamps out and the new ones installed .
Otherewise it has been a great experience .
Masters of their craft sellig mastercraft
I bought my tires yesterday to replace the original Toyo 's on my RAV4 . The minute I drove off to the time I got home I felt like I was driving on a cloud .
I am a homecare nurse and took the car to many different types of roads today and I had an excellent ride .

THe best source I've found for hard to find cd 's in R&B .
The sales person on the phone made it very easy to find the set of clubs I wanted and at a good price .
I ordered the new complete set of Adams Idea clubs including the golf bag .
I previously saw the same set in a store for more money .
The clubs were delivered to my door 2 days later .
I will shop on your website again in the future .
Your price was better than another discount online company I have used in the past .
Hard to find part .
Prices are a little high , but they had a part that I couldn't find elsewhere .
slow getting my order
Needed my part quickly and it took a long time for processing 12 days and waiting
I ordered Kelife ( Douglas Lab ) second time .

Fantastic way to find good accommodation
We found using House Trip gave us the opportunity to see what our accommodation was like , and how much it would cost , before committing ourselves .
The choice was great and we had good offers of availability .
The prices were also good .
We were able to check where the property was on the map to make sure it was in the location we wanted .
We have another property booked through House Trip in the summer and would definately use the site again .
Great place to stay
Great Place . Great Location .
Great Staff :D
They were efficient and arrived on time and changed my tyres quickly and gave me confidence to set off .

I was delighted to see that they offered a really cheap next day delivery service , even if your order is placed on a Sunday they'll get it to you by Monday and it only cost £ 3.95 which is what most companies charge for a regular delivery !
Great service , with next day deliver , will definitely shop with them again

I really like these guys .

And they have lots of reward opportunities .
Overall I'm very satisfied .
I couldn't be happier
I received the part I ordered in 2 days .
it 's installed and working beautifully .
I couldn't ask for better quality and the cost was much lower than my local auto parts store , and I never had to leave the house .
Can't say enough and I don't expect to have to go anywhere else for parts .
Nice clothes at a decent price
I have bought many sweaters from this site now and they are warm and as the picture shows also true to size so far .

Just what we needed
The door handle was broken on my wifes Ford Fusion .
Expecting it to be a costly repair , we limped along until I found PartsGeek . com .
They had what I needed to make the repair at a very reasonable price .
The part safely arrived as promissed and on a cold morning , I was able to easily install it saving $$ .
Now I know where to get replacement parts for our vehicles to do some repairs myself .
This was a complete no-worries experience with better options and a huge savings over other companies .
For starters the staff was incredibly friendly and felt like i was family , the contract was month to month with one month free , the location was perfect and i had choices of my unit location .
I couldnt ask for more except for them to move all my stuff for me .
I didnt ask but now i guess ill never know .
Reliable and efficient
Tower Health website is easy to navigate , the ordering process is straight forward and everything I ordered was in stock and despatched quickly .

Cooker was extremely well protected in its packing and the delivery guys were very friendly and careful .
Great Prices !
My friend mentioned using this website and I had to check it out for myself !
I love the ability to adjust price if you have found the same supplement on a competitors site !
I was also blown away by how many great freebies they have at checkout !
Great way to check out new products .
I will definitely being making another purchase from this website !

So simple and easy .
The food came right to the door ... No driving and fast delivery !
Noone does it better
Shopto . net are the best experience I have ever had while buying games and games related bits off the internet .
Prices are good , delivery is free , and their new points scheme has added rewards to my purchases .
I have always had positive experience 's with them , from preorders , to sales , and even digital downloads .
No other shop ( retail or online ) has ever come close .
Simple , efficient and good value
Simple , efficient and good value .
Prompt and efficient
VetRXDirec made it easy to fill and refill prescriptions with my vet
best prices and service around
there prices are always the best and for name brand parts not junk .
unlike other retail places with house brands that do not last .
i always buy from partsgeek and i tell all my friends and relatives about them .
great service everytime .
Everything is as they advertised .
Delivery excellent and there was no surcharge for a weekend delivery .
Delivery men polite and helpful .
Oven in perfect condition and at a good price .
I would recommend them and use them again .
Professional and friendly staff .
Dedicated to helping me .
While buying a used car was daunting due to my poor credit score , the folks at Drive Time were sure they could help me own a high quality used
They were right !
There was a good selection of vehicles and I decided
on a late model Volvo .
Overall , a good , hassle free experience .
Personal , rapid , honest , fair
I did not care for the first price I was offered , and without saying anything , got a second email almost immediately telling me they had his appraised my MacBook Pro .
This time the offer was what my research indicated was a fair price .
I shipped the unit , and the same day that it was received got an email confirming receipt , and later the same day another email informing my that y check had been mailed .
I received the check the next day .
The whole experience was what it should have been .
I would recommend GoRoostr and do business with them again .
They do not answer the phone !
I booked one room at a great rate but was only allowed to book one at a time .
I needed two rooms for my family , but when I immediately went back for the second , the same room had gone up 10% !
Easy to order , quick delivery .
Would by from them in future .
E-spares saves the day - again
I've used e-spares several times so when the washing machine door mechanism broke I knew where to find the part and be shown how to fit it .
What could be simpler ?
E-spares are top notch .
I went for the next day postage as my lovely wife couldn't be without the Machine for more than a day and it arrived as promised .
Avoid Avoid Avoid
I'm usually very on the ball at seeking reviews before placing orders especially for expensive items .
What was I thinking of on this occasion ?
I guess I was taken in by their web site stating item was available .
I didn't realise it was to be imported .
Although I placed order in good time for Christmas it didn't arrive as date got nearer .
Got in touch as was told stock was an issue .
I decided to cancel order as no date could be given .
I'm still trying to get a refund a month later .
I'm now passing over to my bank to pursue under the credit act .
So wish I'd reviewed company first and read the many , many reviews of from those that have had similar unhappy experiences .
Please avoid Simply Electronics .
They're Simply Appalling .
Correspondence polite but worthless .
This company needs investigating .
much better than TYRE-SOME driving to fitters !
Very competitive prices and loads of choice .
Great to be able to pick a time to suit me .
When the fitter arrived he was quick , polite and did the job well .
I would have given five stars if it wasn't for the fact I have a wheel wobble at 70mph .
I didn't have this before so must put it down to wheel balancing .
To be fair , I haven't been back in touch as I'm certain etyres would put it right but it should be right 1st time .
That said , I would use again and recommend .
Caught napping but am sleeping well
Bed arrived quickly and is very well made .
Instructions took a little time to get to grips with but once you get going its not too difficult .
When constructed it aint going nowhere !
When looking to buy I thought it was a good price but Time4Sleep do not tell you VAT has to be added then the delivery charge so it soon mounts up .
That said , I'm still pleased with the bed and it looks great in the room .
Happy I Went with Them
I ordered a Panasonic camcorder from ShopBLT . com .
They had the best price on the Web .
Their customer service is excellent .
The shipping was good .
I saved 5% off the next lowest price and didn't have to sacrifice anything for it .
What 's not to like about the deal ?
They didn't fit
I bought Persol glassed via the Internet .
Unfortunately they were too narrow and there is no fix for that .
I have returned them and am waiting to see that I get a credit .
Outstanding Source for parts .
If you want a part that works and fits , at a great price , this is the place to buy them ... Period !
Quick delivery and always have what I need .
Great service .
Every time you order something you expect that it happened just like the page told us and that 's exactly what happened .
Very bad experience
Your customer service folks could not properly handle a change and gave me confusing answers .
Had to cancel order and go but the clubs at Dicks .
Nice service .
I had to make a pick up date change and there were no issues with my changes .
Thanks , I will use the service again .
Great price , fast service , good products
I just used Parts Geek for the first time and was very pleased .
Can't believe didn't have to pay so much for printer ink , all good working well and very qick delivery
Order arrived right on time and as expected !
I'm very pleased with the quality of the order and the staff for making sure it arrived on time !
Amazing prices and offers !
PetFlow is amazing .
The products and prices are amazing and combined with the free shipping offers its just an opportunity that I can't resist .
I have 2 cats and a dog and this is the perfect way to shop for them .
What I also love is that the treats and products are healthy and American made !
What 's better than that ?
got information easily , ordered easily
everything worked will
Great idea , IMPOSSIBLE to install .
I loved the idea of the stick on Whiteyboard .
I spent over 1 hour working with another person to install the 4x6 product .
The end result was nothing short of an eye sore and embarrassing .
As we attempted to make adjustments to the " removable " white board , it began to peel paint and parts of the wall off with it .
The ergonomics of the install make it almost impossible for a nonprofessional to hang .
The finished product had wrinkles and bubbles and looks terrible .
I would not recommend the product to anyone that I actually liked .
Great idea , impossible install .
They deliver what you want when they say they will !
We've now placed a number of orders with Viovet and they have been excellent - the orders are always correct and delivered the day expected .
Prices seem to be competitive and the website is easy to use particularly when it comes to re-ordering items - it 's really straightforward .
Ordered and received a complete furnace/AC/A-coil package , received very quickly , and there are/were no problems -- installation is complete .
The one-sentence review pretty much sums it up .
I have mentioned your website to a close friend and he has already ordered and I believe received products from Ingrms Water and Air .
Thank you for making our switch from our previous 30-year-old heating system and 25-year-old AC to the new Goodman brand received from you .
The parts were delivered on time and at a great price .
Will definitely order from them again !!
Defiance Digital deluxe FAST !
CJS CD Keys is WONDERFUL , fast delivery , I had my key within a minute via the autokey system .
I would highly recommend them !
No Problems Here and will probably order again
I got some entry level performance upgrades and got them pretty cheap , so thanks for that .
I have since installed the parts and am happy to report I am very pleased with the result .
I saved at least $400 doing this myself and the costs of the parts really helped me do this on the cheap , but the quality is very good .
Got all the parts I ordered quickly and with no hassle .
Terrible service from top to bottom
Bought something online .
Didn't fit right so swapped for another size in store .
Tried to then return to store and refund refused .
Contacted CEO twice and eventually got email telling me how sad they were and offering refund .
Tried to now progress this twice but still no response .
is the best investment idea occurred to them up the ego of a woman to always look beautiful with her ​​beautiful heels good price on every thing
The Raw Food World has very good unusual healthful products , some of which you can't get in local health food stores .
I like the products I've received and the service is excellent .
The shipping is fast and the packages come well wrapped and protected .
Also , Matt Monarch often has videos explaining the use of some products .
I like The Raw Food World .
After designing the second card and moving on to check out , I lost everything .
If you are ordering more then one card with different delivery date or addresses .
Its best to order separately , so you will have tracking numbers for each card ordered .
This way you will be able to see the date of delivery for each card and person .
I did not see the final card , but loved the way it looked and the ability to customize with special photos .
Over all I would recommend .
Hope this will help you .
Great customer service !
Extremely kind people .
Great deals !
My car rental reservation was very easy & accurate .
I recomend Travelocity for its value , ease of reservation system , and no stress
approach to the travel business .
Best site for tennis in " the world "!!!
I recommand you tennis nuts because :
1 . Michelle ( cust service ) is really professional and comprehensive
Really fast and low cost shipping
Good stuff , a lot of variety .
4 . really good communication with custumer representant ( Michelle ) .
fast service with getting part out
you are fast in sending the part out however you are very slow in getting back to the customer if there is an issue with the part .
the part I order is wire wrong and needs to be return and another sent to me sent ticket in on Saturday and it is now Monday at 1pm there is no one to talk to in person that is not good service .
fast shipping and great prices thanks
fast shipping and great prices thanks
Great group to work with .
The women in our office are great to work with .
Whatever you ask of them the do it is done with a smile and very quickly .
If there 's an issue they can't resolve the find the person who can .
You aren't going to find better front office help in Dallas .
Really trustful seller .
Fast and accurate Service
Excellent service and fast shipping .
Needs shoe boxes
I like shoes but not that their in bags .
Will probably not order again .
Should be in shoe boxes
HAPPY WITH PRICING AND SHIPPING SERVICES .
NUMBER ONE BUYERS
Beating competitor prices is dynamite !
Entering another companies website and their price to get 5% cheaper seemed too good to be true , but I just placed an order without any hitches .
Thank you suuplementwarehouse.com , I'll be back !
Truly displays the 8 steps of best customer service
When you deal with papermart you can expect :
1 - Someone to answer the phone
2 - Not making promises they can't keep
3 - What should be rule #1 , listening to customers
4 - Have a complaint ?
They deal with it appropriately
5 - Helpful - even if there 's no immediate profit in it
6 - Knowledgeable and trained staff
7 - They take the extra step
8 - They throw in something extra
Go Papermart .
I would normally have given them 5 stars as they have always been a first class company .
However since dropping my favourite juice that I've bought for years , I'm not only left sobbing in my own self pity but left ' med high ' and dry .
I could have been told that they would stop selling it giving me the chance to at least buy lots of it , but I didn't get any warning .
Bring back my original grape , please !
I'm not being selfish or vindictive by posting this , just saying how I really feel .
There 's flavour and there 's Decadent Flavour
Fast shipping and quality juice .
Don't need to say anything else .
Excellent service , fastest shipping I've ever had !
First class ....... The title says it all .
I had to contact them regarding my own mistake on ordering and they bent over backwards to help out !
Friendly busy store
We were served by Malcolm , who we has sold us equipment before .
The store is very busy and being Saturday the staff were under a lot of pressure .
Malcolm was very helpful in showing us the various options available for a 32 " TV ; the choice is bewildering , but as luck would have it , they'd sold out of most of the units we were interested in .
Malcolm suggested we bought the latest LG 2014 model and said we'd notice the difference .
He also said that the TV would come with a VESA backplate adaptor in the box .
He turned out to right about the former and incorrect on the latter .
We are delighted with the product and his help and guidance was key to our satisfaction .
I've ordered the VESA mounting plate on Amazon so no worries there , Richer don't sell them anyway .
Interestingly they fit them to their display TVs so I'd make a suggestion to the Richer Sounds buyer to get some in , I think you'd sell a few .
Thanks Malcolm ,
I was looking for a replacement battery pack for an emergency lighting fitting and this web site was the only one that could supply it .
Furthermore the company offered to send me the remainder of the order whilst the battery pack was on order , this arrived the very next day .
So I can't see how the service could be improved !
quick , in stock , good website
What I needed , when I needed it .
I spend £300K with my plumbers Merchants every year , but you chaps were quicker for an order of one light commercial circulator .
You have got to know excatly what your want because these people don't have a clue
The prices are great , if you can get the correct part .
I gave them the correct Ford Motor Company part number , and they still sent the wrong parts .
Their website is dumb .
The grill for the fog lights is reversed -- they list the one for the right side as left , and vise-versa .
I sent them a picture of the car , and they still could not get it right .
They did send a left side fog light , but it had a bolt circle that was too large to fit the grill that was correct for the right side .
I am a bit pissed that I have to pay return shipping for their screw ups .
Now had I ordered a wrong part , that would be different , but they fucked up .
no more hunting for me
Found this great site called Hunt office , would recomend it to you , great for all your office supplies .
I purched my cartridges for my printer from them , and am very happy with the service plus how quickley my package arrived ,
I love this pillow !
I'm not only sleeping better but I wake up without the sore neck .
I recommend these pillows to all my USA Martial Arts students because I use them and believe in what the company represents .
Great for anyone wanting more comfortable and restful sleep .
Try a pillow , you'll love it !
Very helpful easy to use site
A good selection of products .
When my computor crashed I called and spoke to a lady to place my order ( Hannah/Gemma ?
) who was very helpful .
Everything arrived on time and in order .
My only slighly negative comment is the prices , on a price match alot of items can be found cheaper .
But overall very impressed !
good customer service and good price
i have only just order a wide angle lens ... talked with a customer service guy ... was very helpful to help me find the right one .
Not Accurate/Login Issues
My credit report that I see online with Transunion and Experian are not the same here .
There is valuable information missing .
Also it sometimes just won't let me log in ,.
I will try and login and it will stay frozen .
I won't be using this when the trial is over .
Easy website to look at and order , quick delivery
I purchased Husky Floor Liners for my 2005 Grand Cherokee .
They came faster than anticipated in an undamaged package and were exactly as described .
Gotta love partsgeek.com !
I was amazed at how fast &I easy it was to get the cash I desperately needed !
The money was deposited into my account the next business day !!
Although I never received the approval/denial email I was told would be delivered within 24an hours of applylig .
The interest rate is astronomical , but the convenience was unbeatable .
I was also not instructed how to make additional and/or principle-only payments .
If I could be get guiidance on this I would consider myself a satisfied new client .
Convenience at a click of a button !
I love this service .
As a disabled person it allows me to order my repeat prescriptions and have them delivered to my door .
As well as that , I can order other items as and when I need them , knowing that I'm getting the right product at a good price .
Great , fast service .
Would highly recommend .
Great service .
You SO need to use Interparcel .
It gives you options , it gives you prices , and above all , it gives you the service .
I love the fact that I can send from home instead of traipsing to the post office , So for anyone who is disabled ( like me ) or has a young family at home , this is just so convenient .
Fine products ; prompt shipping .
Reasonable prices .
I am a repeat customer .
My purchases have been processed and mailed promptly ; items are more than satisfactory .
Prices are reasonable .
I have contacted West Coast Shaving on tow occasions .
Received prompt and friendly responses .
I recommend them .
Wait until you deliver before asking for a review
I haven't received the product yet , hence I can't rate the service .
Quick purchase , no hassle & great product
I found Zest Beauty after my usual dermalogica website was no longer selling the product I wanted ; Zest Beauty was easy to navigate , I found the product I wanted straight away and it was easy to purchase online & it arrived a few days later .
Great service .
Easy dealings and great choices !
Second time buying from boohoo.com and found it very easy .
Still have to return an item that doesn't fit me but had no problems with this last time so look forward to an easy returns process again .
Really like their selection of clothing , always find something I like .
Great products and prices
Had everything I wanted and could find it quickly .
Great prices and I know the quality is solid !
I had problem with selection
I wish I had got a better service in helping understand the ingredients in your product .
The operator was not able to explain the difference between a CHELATE and a NON CHELATE magnesium that i tried to order .
On the contrary , the operator sent me a link to do the research myself on the subject .
I don't need advise .
I just want information on your own product .
Got what i ordered on time and didn't have to haul the 30lb bag from store .
Came right to my doorstep on time !
Fast Service Doheny 's is the only supplier for me
I have been a customer for several years , The reason I continue with Doheny 's Supplies are simple .
The cost is either equal or lower than anyone else , I know when I order something either parts or supplies for my pool , I know it will be shipped fast and I get it in a few days .
If I call , I speak to a friendly person on the phone and willing to help me .
If I rate the company , and using the numbers 1 -- 10 , Doheny 's will be a 10 .
I dont want sell anything , or you .
try the company one time and you will be coming back time and time again .
CUSTOMER SERVICE SECOND TO NONE !
If you want top notch customer service contact Sarina Stacy at 4WD !
Not only will she square your requirement away , she'll check back to make sure you're completely satisfied .
It was a pleasure working with the 4WD staff !
Big " BRAVO " for your support to our men and women in uniform !
WELL DONE !
" Retired " Command Master Chief ( SEAL )
Steve ( Currituck , NC )
Good To GO !
Excellent products and outstanding pricing .

Professional , discreet and fast service .
Informative website with useful products for trying to conceive .
Quick and user friendly websitem
Very prompt service .
Love the stethoscope
It was an easy experience .
Very quick and the scope turned out nice
supplement warehouse was very fast and easy .
Not having free shipping is a bummer but i'll take my year of MENsHealth and a free shaker cup instead .
Another website had the product i wanted a few dollars cheaper .
SW matched the price and beat it by 5% .
I will be using this site many more times .
Excellent Choice !!!!
Great customer service .
Took care of my iPad in a very timely manner .
No issues with the device once returned .
Great service & good prices
Used the website several times now & find it a great place to shop for my lenses .
I won't be going back to Specsavers soon !
Everything about this site and my experience with them has been awesome .
A good experience !
A good first time experience , would be great if price could be lowered a little , apart from that , I'm a happy customer .
I would use this service again .
A+++ Supplier of Doggy Stuff
The Prices are fabulous and my dogs love everything they've gotten so far .
Fun , cool , everyone wants one !
I really , really like my named necklace .
I layer it with all sorts of vintage pendants , and it works well
One minute collected , the next delivered .
Great service .
Found this service to be excellent re collection and delivery .
It has to be said the website gave us a bit of aggravation but we got there in the end .
Many thanks .
Rubbery service - thanks
The rubber flooring was delivered on time and flooring great .
This place sells junk !
After I received 110/220 converter plug that was unusable I contacted 11220VOLTS . com on the subject of refund because I had no time to wait for replacement shipment .
I was departing for Europe in couple days so I found replacement elsewhere locally .
A month later after couple more calls on the subject they finally returned me the cost of the item , but said to get a full refund I need to remove my negative review that I had posted here .
I removed the review and called about refund again .
This time they told me I just should wait couple more days .
When I called next time a week later they told me I will not get refund for the shipping cost .
Also they advised me how to fix the item .
I am an Engineer and know very well without their suggestions how to fix it , also I could really make it from scratch .
That 's not the point .
I chose to buy it from these people and they failed to provide reasonable service .
Now they will be dealing with my credit card .
It 's not much only $5 , but why I should pay for their negligence of shipping out junk ?
I will never buy anything there again .
Took way too long , won't be doing it again !
Waist of time , should of just sold it on eBay !
Excellent Service , would recommend to everyone
Excellent prices and easy transactions .
My only concern is the delivery time for online cdkeys , that could be done a little faster in my opinion .
Just what i asked for .
The colors were fabulous
I love Amiclubwear .. Its one of the best sites I have ever purchased from ..
I recommend shopping on this site .. Amiclubwear . com has a great variety of shoes and clothes to choose from ..
The prices are always reasonable .. Amiclubwear is the best ..
I thought the website was too good to be true
Plain and simple : this site has prices that are definitely lower than Chegg , Bookrenter , and of course your campus book store .
My books and audio material was sent out in a very timely manner and they even sent me coupons on my next purchase !
I will make this website my go-to for book renting !!!
Quick , efficient service
I would recommend VetRxDirect to anyone with pets .
You get prompt delivery on orders , and their prices are very reasonable .
Realible and good service
I got the book for my class that I needed .
It came in a reasonable amount of time and the price was decent .
WRONG PART !!!!!!!!!!!
Well the only thing good about this company so far was there fast service getting the part to me .
The wrong part and they have no way to get hold of them only to fill out a slip which they say they will get back to you .
There 1-800 free number gives you three choices , but a voice comes on saying there phone calls are so full they can't get back to you .
If you call there regular number some guy named Buster answers saying he is away from his desk to leave message , but then you find out that his message service is full , so I went to my bank and we are doing this the legal way , and they have so many days to get my refund to me or have legal actions take agaisnt them .
If you go online and read the reviews about this company there is no good reviews in there favor , so until I get my refund from them this company SUCKS !
I have been a customer with Niven & Joshua for several years .
Great and extensive selection of products , prompt delivery , excellent service .
Highly recommended .
I have used them three times to send money to Spain .
Each time the money arrived quicker than they originally said and in total I have saved around £70 when compared to what my bank charges for international money transfers !
with winter drawing on and cold dark nights here for a while , we have a cosy glow around the house with the flickering flame lamps and t-light candles that we recently bought from Festive Lights on line .
They really are nice and we've got all the benefits of a natural flame with totally safe LED lighting .
the lamp also features a silk flickering piece of gauze around the light which makes it look incredibly realistic .
We are also impressed by the swift and efficient service provided by Festive Lights .
Absolutely fast and efficient service !
Travelocity is a great way to book your travels .
A great company with innovative and yet time-tested products always being developed
I think Onnit is a great company .
They're taking innovative ideas , designs combined with time-tested ingredients , qualities and approaches , combining them into a usable , effective and meaningful product for people and a culture that need it now more than ever .
That is something I can greatly appreciate .
All the products I've used from them I've been more than satisfied with and recommend them regularly .
I was introduced to Onnit over a year and a half ago by Joe Rogan , Joey Coco Diaz and other real and genuine people who are still trying to hold things down in the crazy fucked up world .
It 's all about standing up being accountable for yourself , taking care of yourself and intern being able to help take care of others .
We're all in this together .
Thanks to Onnit , we're another step closer to getting back to REAL in society , culture and the world .
I pray to God that they'll be able to help us continue to carry on and still continue to surprise us with even better things to come .
Excellent service .
Quick and efficient
The fitter turned out on a wet and cold morning but he was cheerful and quickly fitted my two new tyres without any problems .
Once completed he went through the paperwork and advised on the condition of my two remaining tyres without any pressure
An excellent service that I would use again
reliable with good prices
I've made 2 orders with this site .
the first one i ordered 4 things and just 1 of them took a few days longer because it had to come from a different warehouse .
the 2nd time i ordered 4 things again but they all came the next day in the same package .
Great machine .
( babylock prestige )
It is very good machine for this pric e.i love it and easy to use , simple , basic . beautiful stitc h.I recommended !!
Excellent service !
I was impressed with the speedy service provided and the friendly driver who made the delivery .
Ine Stop Shopping
If tries are what your car needs look no more just go to Marvis your tire problems are solved .

I called the dealer on my sons mustang gt about parts .
Fuel pump $597 I looked on line could only find aftermarket parts ranging from $250 to $400 .
I wanted genuine parts .
I was very happy to find you geeky guys had one .
Not only did I get a great price .
I found a coupon for $10 off .
Free shipping . and no sales tax .
The cost was$334 for the pump to my door for almost half price .... thank you thank you .
I will definitely Shop with you geeks again .
Very cool .
Quick and efficient , I will definitely use again .
I needed the translation of a house sale document and I needed it quickly .
I submitted it online and got it the very next day !
Fast , and accurate and a fair price .
ok because of the discounts
The site charges a 10% surcharge on every menu item so you're better off ordering directly from the restaurant itself , especially when it takes I don't know how many points to actually get a reward .
Food delivery and points to purchase things the best
I absolutely love delivery.com they offer deliveries in my area and I get points for every delivery I get so I can purchase anything I like with my points .
I saved all my points up and got a 100 amazon gift card that 's like getting paid to eat Lol .. Love this company would recommend it anyone
deceitful business practices
basically , the quote was $129 .
the amount I paid was $129 + EUR78 (=$109) .
Total = $238 .
In other words the quote was at 50% of the actual price .
If I had the full picture , when I booked via kayak , AutoEurope would not have been to cheapest and I would not have gone for them .
And that is deceitful .
The response from AutoEurope will be : check our ts and cs .
And I did beforehand .
I saw the 20% surcharge , tax , or whatever it was .
I did not see the minimum EUR50 .
That required some digging into the document .
I can understand that quote is not always what you pay .
however , where I draw the line is when the quote is half of what I will pay .
Or , the actual amount is double what you quoted me .
that is not acceptable .
your systems should have rules in place when the quote is that far off and serve up a proper quote .
Hence AutoEurope has deceitful business practices !
always great customet service !
Live the email letting me knownof specials and then being able to pick up previous orders and just get new order done quickly and easily !
1/4 the price of airport lots
Easy reservations to make online , hotel used has secure lot , fast shuttle service from hotel lobby to terminal door .
Great service and good stock range .
I used Cult Pens to order a refill for a pen that I had been unable to find anywhere else .
The stock range was very good , ordering was straightforward and there were no hidden costs .
The refill arrived within a few days , well-packaged and with the pleasant introduction of a good-quality , complimentary biro .
Top notch !
The jacket arrived within two days of ordering and is exactly as described .
Even better , it was £20 cheaper than the same jacket at a leading retail store !
I shall certainly be shopping with country attire again .
best thing i have ever done
I got on this site and checked out to see what my old phone was worth , i must admit i was a bit worry , but now i will have no worrys and if i have anymore phones laying around i will be back to do it all again .
I also referrred them to my friend .
What you want in glasses , at a great price , and delivered to your home free .
I found the glasses I liked at a store , but they didn't have the exact style so I googled the brad name and number and up came Smartbuyglasses .
It was so easy , I found the style that I wanted , and at a great price , plus they were delivered free to my home .
I would highly recommend giving it a try , it worked for me .
Fast shipping and great product !
Was really surprised of the price on the side steps .
I ordered them up and within days they were at my doorstep .
Install was easy and will definitely buy again from 4wd .
Professional and personable customer service .
Have had only one transaction so far but was quite impressed with the customer service .
I would not hesitate , and plan on doing business again with them .
No problem with Blackcircles but the garage used to fit they tyres was not great .
Had an appointment for 9.30 on the saturday which suited me .
I was phoned by Blackcircles on the Friday to ask if I could have the car at the garage for 8 oclock on the saturday which i agreed to .
I assumed that by making the effort to have the car in so early i would not have to wait long .
I was asked to come back in 2 hours .
2 hours to change 2 tyres seems a long time to me .
Happy with they tyres , not happy with the service !
I have had very good service from this company regarding price and delivery .
I am satisfied with all the dealings i have had with them and would recommend them to anyone .
Very Good Product and service thank you
Quick delivery of the product .
I certainly use this company again .
Great Parts At Great Prices And Quick Delivery .
I searched many sites before coming across Parts Geek .
They had exactly what I was looking for at prices that blew away the competition .
Delivery was fast .
I highly recommend Parts Geek to anyone looking for auto parts online .
Save money and time .
great items , good price , fast service
they always have what we need at a good price
Why stand in line at the store when I can buy game cards for my kids online and get them within seconds ?
Always reliable and saves me so much time !
I love the shirt
If there is one thing I can add its that when you select a color on your site , in addition to having the color change , have the name of the color pop up to .
I ordered what I thought was orange and got gold .
It didn't state gold drying the setup but it did say it after I checked out .
I probably would have selected a different color .
All in all I love the product and service
Petflow has great specials
I've ordered from Petflow on several occasions and my dogs love their products .
I love their sales .
Thanks , for years of good service Eeuroparts .
I appreciate the the effort made to use functional yet recyclable packing materials , the prompt shipping and the amount of readily available in stock items .
Your level of communication is also appreciated , wether it 's about the status of my order or specific/general part info on a site like SAABNET , that you are a supporting sponsor of .
Well done .
Quick , easy service .
Ordering was a breeze .
Items arrived in good time and exactly as expected .
Definitely recommended .
Quidco is a definite no brainier !
I encourage everyone to join Quidco , it 's amazing how much you can save !
Got what I expected
Got what I expected
Very very easy shopping due to the staff .
I would recommend everybody to check the DRIS web site before making decision to buy any scuba equipment .
I will make another shopping in next couple weeks .
fast , efficient and reliable
Use lenstore for your llenses , they will save you money and remind yoou when you are running out so you will never run out .
They generally arrive in 3 days
No problem shopping there again very helpful
Very pleased with my purchases delivery exactly as quoted and on time slot given
Salesman very professional and polite
Will be very happy to purchase products from Oakland again
Excellent experience , prompt delivery
Ordered a Tamron SP 24~70 f 2.8 VC for Canon .
Good price , excellent email communication and prompt international delivery .
Very happy .
Does Not Protect Digital Transactions !
I bought downloadable content through an online affiliate .
He never sent me the link to download , but took my $70 right away .
I tried several times to contact him with no resolution .
I turned to PayPal .
They told me I should try and contact the seller , but they could not help me because I had bought downloadable content .
I showed proof of my purchase .
PayPal contacted the seller , and told me he would send the link .
He did not .
He then ignored 40 email messages from me politely requesting the link he owed me .
PayPal said he had told them he had sent the link and there was nothing more they could do .
Any sense of financial or fiduciary security you have with PayPal is an illusion !
They do not protect their customer , and do not do anything to regulate illegal and dishonest activity from sellers on their site .
PayPal cannot be trusted .
travel made easy
easy step by step guide to buy travel insurance .
even an unsure senior like me couldnt go wrong .
best of all prices a fraction of what other insurers are charging .
bought insurance years ago with you and will certainly do so in future .
well done multitrip in keeping prices more than competitive .
Easy , efficient , effective and good value
What is there not to like ?
Efficient service offering low fees for international money transfers as well as competitive exchange rates .
Much cheaper than using traditional bank methods and large money transfer corporations .
During the transfer there is constant communication regarding the progress of your money and it doesn't appear to disappear into the ether for days on end earning interest for someone else .
Based on my experience to date , I would recommend them to anyone .
Quick and efficient
This is an easy way to make money transfers between UK and Spain at a very good rate .
unfortunately there is no way yet to set up a regular transfer similar to a standing order .
Best seller , I recommend
I can only recommend
A very fast service , was kept informed every step of the way .
The service I received was excellent , not only was it fast , ( I ordered Monday night , was delivered wednesday ) but I was kept informed every step of the way .
They rung me , e-mailed and texted me to let me know delivery times , and also gave me a tracking number .
A reliable service that I would deffinatly use again .
Can't do better than this
I ordered a seal kit for the leaky ShowerForce mixer head , the price was very competitive , P&P a minimum , and delivery very fast .
Right Product , Right Price , Right On .
Great product at a great price and it arrived on time .
Ordered a part for my son 's car .
Found the price to be half of other sites .
It arrived on schedule .
Very happy with this purchase and will order from them again .
Just what I needed .
Parts came fast , and was just what I needed .
How not to love JB Prince ?
Great deals , they have all the equipment you need , ship worldwide and the service is amazing .
I always leave the store with a smile in my face .
Will use them again .
The transaction was very swift .
Great play to buy any electronics
I use them now instead of Amazon .
Great service !
After submitting my request for a contractor , I received three calls from contractors within 10 minutes .
I recommend this service to everyone .
Really on top of things
After being alerted 4 months ahead about a needed change in a villa for our 2-week stay that was beyond their control , Summer in Italy worked with us to find a wonderful alternative so that we would not be disappointed .
Melanie was attentive to the details and our list of " must haves " and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of .
Wonderful service !
you don't find this everyday .
I travel alot and don't do very many reviews , but this one was worth mentioning !
I would recommend the Summer in Italy team .
Great Prices !
Great service !
Fresh Product !

I've been buying with this guys since 2010 , no problem at all , good quality-price product and the delivery very succesful
Found my girlfriend on here !
Great app lots of people to talk to .
Never got iTunes confirmation and I cannot restore the phone .
I received confirmation via email from myimeiunlock.com that the phone was unlocked .
However , I never received a confirmation via iTunes that it was unlocked ( " Congratulations !
You're phone is now unlocked !" ) ...
In addition , as per their instructions on their site , since I didn't automatically get the notification , I attempted to restore the phone from backup ; however , I would get an error message that this device is not " eligible " for the restore .
I have sent them email after email and message after message and I have never received any kind of response .
I will have to take the phone to Apple today and hopefully get another phone ...
I wish I didn't have to take it to get another phone though ...

Fantastic service !!
I recently bought my Dad a Barbour cap for a christmas present .
I ordered early as you never know how long these things take to arrive .
To my pleasant suprise it was within a few days !!!
It is just as it described on the website .
I will definately be ordering from Country Attire again .
Quick Turnaround - High accuracy
My first experience with Rev was fantastic .
While they guarantee turnaround to be within 48 hours it was much quicker than that and highly accurate .
I immediately sent them two more jobs and downloaded the app for my phone .
It seems will we are off to a nice partnership .
The price was very competitive -- close to the best I could find .
I would highly recommend this service to others .
They had what I wanted and shipped it immediately .
the best i'av bean trying others for five years
This is the best there is
Completely AWESOME !!
I was SO upset when I couldn't find my passport .. two weks before our trip !
I googled passports and found Express Passport .
On the very first contact with them , they were fantastic !
Step by step , they got me through the process !
We did a ' hand carry ' and the whole deal !
These are a little more complicated , but do-able they said .
They were right !!
In a week , I had my passport !!
And thank you SO much to all at Express Passport !
You are professional and wonderfully personal in your approach to helping people !
Thank you ! Thank you !
Thank you !
Great price , right part , average to slow delivery , extra steps to return core .
Best price I could find by far .
Shipping was a little slower than from some sites I have used .
Required obtaining a return authorization number prior to returning core that slowed down getting the core charge back .
Excellent experience .
Excellent website and experience .
The website was easy to use and provided a better choice of flights than the airline 's own website .
Also significantly cheaper .
Highly recommended !
I use PetFlow often to send my grandson -Kota treats , food and toys .
He lives in Austin Texas with my daughter .
Kota loves PetFlow as well , what good dog does not like the FedEx with a arm full of goodies from their favorite store .
Thanks for keeping Kota close to Grandmother !
jAlbum is user-friendly , has great potential to personalize one 's product or portfolio , and is very reasonably priced .
Not only does jAlbum offer an attractive interface to enable the designing of one 's OWN site , but the diversity among the options and personalizations available is tremendous .
There is a skin for every user , idea , and intent .
Better yet , the cost ( or lack thereof , in the case of the free storage option ) is the most reasonable I've seen - and , while offering a superior product , this polarization is extraordinary .
No refund although I didn't need the room
I have been using priceline to get rooms due to relocation for my job .
This past week my job told me after I booked a room that they didn't need me .
I attempted to get a refund for the room I booked and was told there was no way to get one .
So I ended up spending 300.00 for a room for a week that I didn't have to spend .
I think the policy needs to be revisited for occasions such as the one I stated .
I have used this site on several occasions but will now consider other avenues .
I will not recommend this site to any of my business partners nor friends .
Tried for 4 days to fix my printer but with no success-total cost £0
Excellent service from start to finish
First time using Mazuma and would certainly recommend them .
Service was excellent and received cheque within days .
Was really pleased with the quick service .
Would definitely use again
Excellent service , order arrived next day .
Thoroughly recommend Cult Pens for good prices and brilliant service .
Dependable , Reliable , Prompt
STG can be counted on without reservation to purchase your motorcycle needs .
Fantastic service , great price
Really easy to use , great quotes , reliable driver .
Thank you .
Brilliant bar stools
Great service and product- thanks !
Great place to shop !
Highly recommended site for great prices and easy shopping experience !
Your professional and sympathetic approach made all the difference .
I was really impressed by the calmness and understanding of Shirley who handled my call .
Some of the questions were quite sensitive for her to ask , although she must be used to it . We talked through my condition , treatment and recovery and she was able to provide me with a comprehensive and well priced quote .
I think it is very fair of your company to ask for a larger excess only if and when any claim is related to my cancer rather than put it in a very high up front fee , as I had been quoted by another company .
It is clear to me that your standards are set by those who understand how difficult it can be to be dealt with normally once you have had cancer .
Thank you .
Best supplement website
Supplement warehouse always has the best prices on supplements , lots of free samples , and cheap closeout deals .
I have been ordering from them for 4 years and I have always been pleased with their service .
I Highly recommend them !
««« Wow what a service ... you guys are great ! »»»
I was so blessed and impressed by rev translations ... I had used them like almost 3 years ago .
This week I needed a 1,250 word count document translated from English to French for Karlees adoption in Haiti .
I emailed the document over around 12:00 pm .
Tuesday and told them in the notes that I needed this document asap but certainly before Friday the 22nd .
Well at 6:30 pm or so on the same day ( Tuesday ) I had the French translation in my inbox !!!
Very well done my friends !!
I will recommend you to anyone who needs translations done !!
Thanks again and blessings to you all for serving us in this way !!

AHHHH-MAZINGG DEAL !
I was looking at this exact same item at office depot for 330 and decided to look for a better deal online and found this at BH photo .
What an amazing deal , I got to demo the unit in store and I was sold .
BH photo just help me seal the deal !
WITH FREE SHIPPING !
Thank you !
Efficient friendly service
I placed my order over the phone rather than online because I needed further information . The person I spoke to was very helpful and efficient .
Highly recommended .
Great place and wonderful customer service !
( CHEMEKA EDWARDS ) thank u so much !
Coolshop is a cool shop !
I have ordered from Coolshop a few times now and most of the time they have the cheapest deals on new games but not only that , they are reliable too !
Games have always been delivered on time and any codes sent well in advance .
Can't fault them so far .
Keep up the good work Coolshop !
Fan dabby dozy
Ordered 2 psn cards had trouble with the credit card option when trying to pay don't know why but used pay pal instead and recieved my psn codes in no time at all and worked just fine fantastic service and cheaper than the other sites I found all in all great .

Better place to shop
Everything was fantastic and on time
Fantastic service highly recommended ,
Received money within the hour , very quick and professional service .
Will definitely use again !
Great company !
Awesome communication .
I saved fifty bucks buying from Parts Geek .
I also ordered the wrong part and returning it was a breeze .
Quick response to my emails .
No serious problems .
Pretty satisfactory .
I wish I didn`t have to choose between Irish Ferries and Stenaline at the outset .
I would prefer just to choose the route and decide on the ferry company when I was presented with price and choice of sailings .
Everything ordered arrived promptly .
Fantastic Service !
After seeing the excellent prices on the site I made an order at 10.00 on a Thursday morning .
Product was delivered the next day at midday .
Not only was postage and packing free but I also received a free Reflex mixer cup too .
Told my colleague straight away who also put in an order for 2 tubs of Reflex protein powder .
Will be telling more friends and using you myself again !
A gorgeous present for grandparents
I bought a heavily discounted vouched from Living Social ( I think - could have been Groupon ) to get a canvas-style picture of my son for my parents .
I think it was £5 for an A4 picture .
These things are always a gamble but turns out I had a great deal .
The website very easy to use and the picture came back within a few days .
I was very pleased with the result .
The picture looked lovely .
On the whole , the good quality and prompt service would encourage me to use Photoworld again , even without the discount voucher , which was probably the aim of the company !
Quality products , good prices
I tried a few protein powders before I discovered My Protein .
Now I wouldn't shop anywhere else .
You know you are getting a quality product - they taste nice , they work and they are really good value .
The website is easy to use and they frequently have offers .
An all round thumbs up from me .
Fantastic service -
Brilliant company .
Well thought out website and next day delivery .
Boilerjuice makes it easy .
User friendly website .
Painless service - and I even got a £10 group saving discount !
Thank you .
Excellent side mirror
I ordered a side mirror for a fraction of the cost from the dealership and it was excellent .
It is immaculate and was ready to paint .
I was very pleased with how well it was packed in the box and how well of a factory match it was .
I'm very happy and after having it painted , its a perfect match .
Thanks so much for saving me $150
Excellent , faster than I expected
Quick service - excellent product
and the price was great as well .
excellent service and product
Very pleased with service and product , website easy and helpful to decide on components .
Good service and good products
Can't Go Wrong
B&H is the best : great inventory .
Great service and ease of ordering make B&H always my first choice for camera needs .
Very good service .
Envirophone are very easy to use .
The envelope comes very fast and so does the payment .
The website is easy to understand too .
Excellent customer service and happy , healthy dogs .
Because I'm feeding 2 small dogs I don't need shipments that often .
So I had to push back my last shipment like 3 times .
Each time I called I was fearful of getting attitude , but not the case at all .
Every service rep I spoke with was always very understanding and happy to help me figure out a schedule that worked for me .
Not the company .
That speaks volumes to me .
I thank my daughter for turning me on to petflow .
Mazy & Piper thank her too !
PERSPI GUARD IS MY SAVIOUR
Perspi Guard works a treat .
Slick and smooth baby , slick and smooth
Pretty good service , only slight negative would be the fluctuating jackets in the sale .
A day later and I may had chosen a different one .
But I guess that 's sales and you just roll the dice ...
I may even buy another , check me out .
The best place in the world for all of my Photography and Video needs .
Always the best products , no gray items ( unless they state that it is ) all covered by legitimate manufacture warranties , and exceptional service getting the products to me quickly .
I have spent thousands of dollars at B&H and will spend thousands more .
best online for price and delivery
I have ordered from Parts Geek numerous times each time I was never disappointed .
These guys are awesome never a wrong part was ever received and there prices are the best .
Way to go keep up the awesome service ..
Right Part/Wrong Color - Boo Hoo !
We would have been completely satisfied but we were sent the wrong color !!
We really need to get this fixed ASAP and getting the wrong color was a disappointment ; however if the right color was sent we would have rated it a 10 !!
stress free parking was stress free !
what a good experience ! everything was organised and we had no problems whatsoever . It was so easy to drop the car off very close to the cruise terminal and the same to pick it up on return . The young man in charge for stress free parking on site was very pleasant and helpful . We would definately use this company again .
Your food is so tasty , it makes it easy to lose weight .
I look forward to meals and don't feel as if I am missing out on anything .
Not having to spend a lot of time on counting , measuring and preparing meals is a real spoil and a time saver .
No shopping , no wastage , no travel costs makes it value for money .
This diet is completely stress free and a pleasure to be on .
Friendly , reliable , efficient - first rate !
Absolutely first-class service .
I recommend this company without reservation .
Great service .
I would recommend

Very satified with the prices and how fast I recieved my parts , I can't buy Localy cheaper .
Suntransfers are excellent . They were waiting at the airport on our arrival and also picked us up from our hotel for the return trip . Very prompt friendly and helpful drivers . Would definetly use them again .
Fast good ! delivery on time !
The best web site i have use !!
Good product , fair price , delivery estimate was off by a week
Very happy with the product and price but the estimated delivery date when I paid was 1 week earlier than I actually received it .
Would deal with them again , but don't expect it in 2-3 days if you're on the east coast .
They actually read my comment i posted on my order and called right away let to me know they didn't have it instead of other people I've dealt with
Excellent service again
This was my second order form AO .
Again a good product , at a great price , delivered on day requested .
Have recommended to a friend who has also bought from AO and was equally pleased with product supplied and service provided .
Quick and No fuss
I needed some replacement parts for my shower .
I was able to search an array of products , find the one I wanted , purchase and get it delivered promptly .
Couldn't have asked for a better service .
Not a chance !
I bought parts , received them , and and email stating if i provided a customer review that i would receive $10 off my next order .
So i took the time to fill out a detailed review .
Only then to find out they will only give me $10 off an order of over .
WHO ORDERS $300 IN PARTS OVER THE INTERNET ?!?
Not only is this deceiving but very unsatisying !
Great website .
It was very easy to enroll .
Your IT people need to help us with Obamacare .
I would recommend your services to my friends .
It was a breeze to get travel insurance .
Outstanding service and delivery !
I was extremly pleased with the speed of delivery of the part I ordered .
I would not hesitate in recommending your organization to others .
easy to order , great communication , fast shipping , part as described .
Fast service and good prices

Couldn't have been better .
I plan to use this resource in the near future .
10 out of 10 customer satisfaction
always pleased with knowlegable customer service and promp delivery
Resolved Issue in a professional and timely manner
Ann was excellent in resolving a return issue .
She worked quickly and communicated well in making sure that I was satisfied .
FLOWERS GREAT BUT THREE WEEKS LATE !
My order failed to arrive at its destination on the specified date , which was crucial .
Then when I contacted iflorist about this they failed to respond twice to my enquiries , even though they promised to .
When I sent a letter to the company with photocopied evidence of my communication with them I received notification that my order would be delivered the next day - 3 weeks late .
Quite frankly what was the point in doing that ?
The intended surprise for our daughter 's celebrations was lost .
It would have been far better to have received my money back .
Very disappointing experience .
Notifications and shipping was prompt , great service .
I purchased a window regulator for a Honda Element ( window motor & track) .
The part ordered was not as good as a genuine Honda part , motor is a little slow and noisy .
The part was much cheaper than a Honda part , so I got what I paid for .
The part was an easy install and it does work well .
Would shop here again .
Awesome Customer Service
They really take care of you at Squaretrade ... my wife broke her iPhone 4S for the 3rd time !
And they didn't miss a beat .... told them I wanted to take it to the Apple Store to get it replaced ... and I got a replacement emailed the receipt and in 24 hours ... money was back in my paypal account .
I use tehm for all my warranties !
Awesome Pet Store !
Awesome and Fast Shipping !
No need to run to my local pet store and get charged more and pay for gas !
Professional , courteous , efficient , fair prices .... Mavis is the best !
Been going to this location for many years .
Recently changed managers but Kevin is great .
I trust them which is the best endorsement I can give
First order , Last order
I spent an entire day waiting for my ordered oil pan and gasket to be put in my car .
It was the wrong one and I have to send it back and now I will have to pay the repair shop much more money to replace the pan .
I am very unhappy to say the least .
I ordered as indicated on the site for a 2004 Chrysler Sebring .
This will be my last order and now I have to go through the hassle of returning the items .
Responsive , Honest , and Timely
Within less than 24 hours of asking for a quote , I received a response back .
Their pricing is very reasonable , especially compared to a few other vendors I spoked with .
The timeline for everything is very quick and efficient .
My shipment of USB drives was delivered in two days .
They are honest , efficient , and the final product looks great .
I would recommend this company for the best priced USB drives .
Helpful website with wide range of showers and parts .
Helpful diagrams and tips of how to fix parts .
Good reviews from other customers eased my mind about my purchase
I am very impressed with this company !
Superior service indeed !

One in a Million Part
I was looking for a power steering pressure line hose for a 2008 Dodge 1500 Mega Cab Larime .
Every auto parts store in town didn't believe that ' Mega Cab ' would make a differance on the part until I proved them wrong .
After searching high and low the only place that carried this part was StockWiseAuto .
They also had the part listed cheaper than any of the other parts that the local stores were trying to get me to purcase .
After ordering the part I was given an expected arrival date and it arrived that morning and was on my truck within the hour .
Truck is purring like a kitten again and is a very happy Mega Cab .
they were nice
It was my first time and she was very polite and respectful .
Delicious and always fresh
The food is always hot and always fresh .
It 's so delicious .
I must order from there at least once a week
Speedy delivery and very keenly priced !
Would recommend the service provided as well as the up to date advice which is supplied on the website .
If it needs to be sent , not dropped or a dent , Interparcel 's the one , you KNOW it is done !
I have used Interparcel for quite a few years now and can honestly say that I have never been let down by them , touch wood !
My parcels have always arrived on time , in good condition - I would ( and indeed have already , several times ) recommend them for excellent service !
Spot On !
Simple to use - helpfull staff - what more could you ask !
If you are fed up with your old web site and need something to promote your business that is fresh and new , and quick and easy to use - then bonline is for you !
Friendly and helpfull staff are easy to get hold of ( and phone you back when they say they will ) which makes a nice change !
If you are not that brilliant with computors like me then just have a trial run , have a fiddle about , and you will discover that you can do your own web page .
Since we have gone live people have only had good words to say about our site , and its not even finished yet !
Great , friendly , efficient , good price
I would recommend Town Fair Tire .
Fantastic service that exceeded expectations
We've insured numerous items with SquareTrade over the years .
Unfortunately , we've had to use their services on several occasions .
Each time our item was repaired quickly and correctly .
Communication is always excellent as you're kept informed each step of the process .
This latest repair was for my wife 's cellphone which she uses for business .
They had it processed and returned to us within a few days and she couldn't be happier .
Excelent place to buy PSN Cards
Is fast , Is simple , Is reliable !
I love this site .... in few minutes I have my code ready to use .
I have used with PSN Cards for US ( I am from Argentina , so I can't buy locally ) and it works for me ...
I recomend this website
Quick efficient and very reasonable
They had what i wanted and arrived within 48 hours of ordering .
Need I say more !
First class service
I ordered the ink and within 48 hours it arrived and at a fraction of the cost of buying it in the high street .
Very good !
Just a day late .
Very good !
Just a day late , but it still worked out in the end .
Very high quality labels !
I made custom wine bottles for my Father who makes his own wine !
He loved it !
I definitely recommend them !
hyundai and volkswagen ... the best
On our recent trip to Europe ... this time it was Germany , Spain and France we had made arrangements for our car rental ( as always ) via auto Europe
Price and quality of the rental cars where first class ...... all where virtually with new cars with diesel engines .... low in gas consumption yet powerful and fun to drive ... Hyuandai
and Volkswagen 's new Touran where the best
Really pleased how quickly I received my order
I had never heard of this company but the pricing was so competitive I thought I would try them out .
Amazed how quickly I received my order .
Good service , accurate product description
In looking for a joint supplement for my arthritic Lab , I found Petflow 's site .
I like that the products are mostly organic and/or natural , and Bunny seems to like the taste of the PetNaturals supplement I bought ( she HATED what I got from the vet) .
The active ingredient is nearly the same and she only needs to take one a day versus 2 or 3 for the vet 's product .
I am a happy camper .
The only suggestion I have is to post the recommended dosage on the web site so that I could have set up the autodelivery right away instead of having to wait until I got the product to figure out when I will need more .
Tashim was courteous and professional .
The only drawback was the overwhelming smell of rubber ... too much and no other place to wait
the only compliant they finish to early .
but well worth the money
Everyone at ExtraSpace Storage was extremely helpful and made the process of Renting a Storage Locker a pleasant experience .
Wow , I'm really happy with the reasonably priced Climate controlled locker I just rented at Extraspace ; the people there are really helpful and explained everything I needed to know .
Now I have more room at home , instead of cluttering my workshop up with all those boxes .
Thanks ExtraSpace !!!!!
I bought ovulation tests and pregnacy tests the price is amazing for how many you can get the sticks are really small that is all i would say as a down fall but would rather save money than have an extra bit of plastic around the stick .
thank you alot .
I ordered a eGo Tank Stater kit and the delivery was fast and cheap .
Product is working well , but every time I take a tank out of the atomizer a small thing with a spike( ?
) comes with it and I have to put it back with a ketter opener .
Conclusion : Great store , good products !
convenience with choices
easy to use , flexible and provides convenience till your doorstep
urban industry is excellent .
great selection of clothing .
i ordered a 10 deep floral shirt ... a shirt i couldn't find anywhere else on the internet .
super easy .
the shirt arrived in quickly even though it was sent from the UK to LA .
big up to urban industry .
On time and under budget
The part was priced so low that I thought a would receive some cheesy part but it is oem .
Problem solved .
I'll definitely buy from parts geek again .
Awesome customer service
Always on time and great service
We were in need of a stylish new way of sending information to clients when we came across Flashbay .
After sending off an email for quotes , Richard responded quickly and from there he went over and beyond to make sure we got what we were after .
The result was fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Flashbay to anyone .
Great Site , Amazon for Pets
I got a friend 's cat a bundle package ( canned food , treats , kitty litter ) for Christmas this year .
Everything arrived as described .
The only things I would complain about although everything turned out ok is that 1 ) They don't have a button next to the orders to dispute or comment on problems with the order and 2 ) FedEx delivered one of my 2-part order to the street across the house ( NOT PETFLOW.com 's FAULT) , even though both parts had the same and correct address :-/
Best one stop shop ever !
Travelocity is the only way to go when booking a vacation .
I have always had good luck .
They have never let me down .
Away from home is the last place I want to be when I am let down .
Quick and very efficient service on an item which is hard to find on the high street .
I was pleasantly surprised at the quick and efficient service .
I could not find the product on the high street .
The cost was also reasonable .
Just perfect !
I spent several weeks calling into my local city centre retail stationary suppliers to buy Waterman blue black ink each time being told they were out of stock .
Eventually I challenged them to look at their purchase orders and tell me when they would be in stock and then they admitted that forced inventory reductions by head office meant they were no longer stocking this particular colour .
Then I looked online and found Cult Pens .
Ordering was very easy and the product arrived through my letterbox two days later .
Completely hassle-free .
Why didn't I think of this sooner !
great parts great prices .... and great service
well what happened to me is i happen to blow a tire on my right passenger side of my car that tire happen to take my right passenger parking light when it blew out .
so being the perfectionist that i am i cant go around having my car looking crazy every1 know that i take good care of my car so i went online which was exhausting then eureka parks geek came up with the exact part i needed it was easy to install and the part got here quickly im truly satisfied and i would use them again for my future parts needs .
thank you parksgeek .
Love having my dog &cat food delivered on a regular basis for a totally reasonable price .
Not so bad
Took a while to receive my key since it was out of stock but in the end I got it after a couple of hours .
This is the best product I have tried for my eyes
This cream is an excellent one .
It is not greasy and made my skin very soft .
After a week of using it I saw big changes on my eyes and face .
I am love with it
I think I had just hit the ' submit ' button when the FedEx guy was pulling into my driveway !
Seriously , though , I was shocked at how quickly my order arrived .
It was accurate ( bought 9 different items ) & well-packed .
This is my second purchase from Chewy . com & I'm a very happy customer .
I told you that this place is fair and the prices are what I'm looking for , for my money and I said this will be the 1st site I will visit , and I checked out others but I chose B&H .
Keep up the good work B&H .
Great selection , fast delivery
Was so excited to find the exact Barbour I was looking for and delivery to the States was free .
Items arrived in a little over a week .
Quality of service and product , easy transaction , fast delivery ... exceptional !
Great business model based on my transaction !
The kind of service a consumer appreciates .
My order was cancelled because they did not have the book I needed .
Which was a hassle because I needed the book ASAP and felt like it would have been better had they said out of stock to begin with .
Price is cheap but goods are great
Bought tooth brushes for my Oral .
B brush .
In Tesco £12 for 4
In Boots the same price but got them through the net for 12 for £12 plus postage .
Great Stuff .
Easy and knowledgeable
I needed some outdoor lighting for our restaurant .
When I told the salesperson what I wanted the lighting for , she directed me to the exact light stand I needed .
She also helped me with the color of LED lighting I would like .
She was knowledgeable and very easy to talk to and deal with .
The lighting was installed yesterday and was perfect .
I would recommend the company to anyone in need of lighting .
Amazing customer service !
I have been a customer for a couple years and there customer service dept is great !
Always answeriNg any question I may have and helping out in every which way !!!!

Smart way to send money abroad
If you want to send money abroad , and in a safe and quick way , use WorldRemit .
I have used them many times , and no problema at all .
Great value with fast shipping !
I ordered a Tekonsha Electronic brake , and a specialized connection harness for my 98 F150 .
Quickly recieved 2 emails telling me my order was recieved , then my order shipped .
A couple days later the UPS man hands me my package .
It was all advertised as " plug and play ", and it sure was !
Mounted the unit , plugged in the harness , boom , it was done , and worked perfectly .
20 minute install .
I had done some shopping around before I madethe purchase .
Everything I read said Teconsha was a great Brake control .
American RV had the best selection and the best price over all .
I will be back to but other items in the future !
would u recommend this ebayer
I purchase 2 meters of 13mm auto flex silicone tube in April of this year , from their ebay site .
I returned the tubing in April this year ( 2013) , after they confirmed via email , they would exchange the original tubing , for a 2 meter continues length of the same tubing .
To-date they have not exchange the tubing , will not return my original hose , nor give me a refund or communicate on the matter .
After sending numerous emails too which they have not responded and phone calls too which they will not return the call after they say they would .
In desperation , I have had to repurchase another 2 meters of 13mm auto flex silicone tube from this company as I have been able to find anybody else who can supply the hose to the specification I am require
I have come to the conclusion these people will not return my original lengths of tubing nor exchange the original tubing , as they originally agreed to do so .
I guess there is no chance of a refund .
The same also applies to ten 16mm silicone tube caps I returned for exchange in March of this year ( 2013 ) after purchasing in February of this year ( 2013 ) still awaiting an exchange , return or refund .
always good , complete , quick and easy
always good , complete , quick and easy
My 220V appliances from Singapore are working in USA now .
I needed three transformers : for a massage chair , a TV and a Thermomix Cooking machine .
For the Thermomix , I need I powerfull transformer , however , I bought the wrong one online .
I called the company and they helped me to exchange it for the right one .
Now everything is working fine .
Service that goes the extra mile and an exceptional product .
Brent couldn't have been more helpful in us securing exactly the right product for our needs to our tight deadlines .
A great customer service experience with fantastic follow up .
SIP is the best in quality and service
The only problem is proper documents were not supplied to US Customs , delaying my parts that I shipped with priority over a week .
UPS , Customs and my own emails still have not addressed the issue yet and my parts are still in warehouse on east coast

I used BoozeCarriage for some holiday beverages .
I was blown away by the delivery to my door .
It was ideal since I was in a time crunch , but I'll use it in the future just to save the hassle of extra liquor store trips .
Plus , I'm able to get harder to find items .
LOVE this company/service !!
Look forward to seeing what 's next from them !

10 OUT OF 10
By far the most convenient and fastest CD-key seller I've purchased from .
From creating the account to purchasing my CD-key I spent less than 5 minutes .
No phone verification hassle involved and I was able to pay via PayPal .
No longer than 10 minutes after I had paid , the CD-key was in my e-mail inbox and was redeemed without problems !
10 / 10 service
Use web ok but dont try and call on phone - but hang in there not all is lost
UPDATE : OK so after holding for another hour ... finally got this very nice man in india who spoke great english .. negotiated to give me a credit 80% of my costs good for a flight anywhere with same carrier , a cost of $200 change plane fee to pay to the carrier ... so I rebooked to go see Grandpa .
Not my first choice but at least they tried .
This took way to long , was a complete hassle when through 5 people to finally get someone to help me but ... cost me a couple of hundred dollars more and at least I wasn't totally out of pocket on this flight .
So you go online , you buy your ticket , you buy trip cancellation insurance and all looks good .
Then you get an email every 5 hours trying to sell you more tickets ... haven't gotten them to turn that off yet .
Now my trip was cancelled .
Yesterday I spent 4 hours on hold , then an Asian-sounding agent I could barely understand came on the phone and after about 20 minutes of futzing around said he couldn't help me and transferred me to the " Concerned Dept " .
This chap futz around for a few minutes only to tell me he didnt cover CheapoAir problems and that I had to call 800-566-2345 ... which turns out to be the same number I had before ... Today I am on hold for 45 minutes and still now response .
This travel company doesn't seem to care .
If you buy a ticket ... dont bother to buy the insurance , it isn't good for anything and of course you will never get these guys on the phone .
I am calling the airline to see if they can help me .... #cheapoairsucks
simplest way to send money to anyone ever
I have been a customer of Paypal , Google wallet and many other systems over the years and Square Cash is the simplest way for someone to send money to another person period .
I love the lack of set up requirements and how easy it is to pick up my smartphone and send ANYONE , even if they don't have an account , money - instantly .
No login , no account set up ... simple , easy ... quick .
Google and paypal should be very scared .... Square Cash wins !
As good as always
It’s the 3rd or 4th time I’ve used Transferwise , had a minor point about the instructions in the email before the transfer but support helped me out super quickly .
Highly recommended .
It was very easy !
I'll be back .
Great price on parts .
Good prices , but hard to reach by phone .
Jerseys best .
I'm glad you changed your mind !
I ordered a bottle of Cardio-C online , and when filling out my order , I saw that you didn't deliver to P . O .
I ordered anyway , but in the comments section , I mentioned that delivery to a physical street address would be so inconvenient for me , but , I needed my Cardio-C . Well , to my surprise and delight , I received it at my P . O .
Box , and , it was shipped Priority Mail !
Well , better service than that is just so difficult to find and companies just don't listen to the voice of the consumer anymore .
I'm glad to say that Pure Encapsulations has me for a very satisfied customer .
I will definitely continue to order from this company , plus , I will tell my friends and family where they can find a company that does care about their online customers !
Thank you for listening to me and Thank You for your great service !
I tip my hat to you !
Surprisely quick !
Like it !
order info !!!!
it was fast , simple and easy ... deliver was delayed
It 's my first time to transact with your company and found it satisfactory .
Four stars as it 's my first time , hopefully the next transaction which I would definitely do , i hope to rate you five stars .
Mammoths are big ... and furry !
Great selection , great prices , and super fast shipping !
I will be back !
Extra days in a warm climate
I went to visit my mother in Nogales AZ in mid February .
Might as well go down there when it is freezing in Wisconsin and pleasant in Arizona .
Booked a Delta round trip through Travelocity .
Tried to use the feature where the ticket is on my smart phone .
When I got to the airport it did not work .
Luckily I had printed a ticket just in case ..
For the trip home I was booked through Atlanta .
I know , " why fly from Arizona to Wisconsin through Georgia ".
But that was the only choice unless I wanted to spend a $100+ extra .
It is getting more and more difficult to get flights to and from Milwaukee .
Of course the big storm hit the southeast while I was in Nogales .
Atlanta was closed down a day before the storm actually hit .
I got to spend two extra days in Nogales where it was over 80degF .
I was staying at my brother 's house and he was getting ready to charge me rent .
The trip home was two stopovers , one in Detroit .
We flew right over Milwaukee to get there .
Iit could have been worse since there was no tight schedule waiting for me back in Milwaukee , but this was not one of the better trip I have booked through Travelocity .
Upstream O2 Sensor for Toyota , 03 Corolla .
O2 Sensor - I did order it and it came in 2 1/2 days .

Always good value
We never check any other agency when bookig a car for USA
Great prices very easy to use

Received our order very quickly , it works and was exactly what I wanted .
Hassle free shopping , thank you .
When I call your 800 # and want to speak with a live body , noboby answers
As a customer who needs to speak with a real person I think you service is terrible .
I have tried several times to speak to a sales rep and I never get to a live person .
I have been in sales for over 30 years and i can't belive how diificult it is to communicate with your firm .
A Trustworth Company to do bussiness with .
I am very happy doing business with North Shore Commercial , I bought two Remote for open my garage door was very easy following the instruction and it was done in less that 5 minutes , I pay 1/4 what others company offer the same remote .
I would do business with these company any time

I LOVE FEELING SAFE
This is a great site to make sure no one tries to steal your life 14.95 a month is well worth it .
A quick and effecient service with sensible prices
This was my first order with Merlin cycle , the item was delivered within 24hrs of payment and I managed to get my new forks at a very reasonable price .
I have already recommended . Merlin Cycles to friends and will continue to do so .
Excellent in all areas - communication , content , deadlines
I was referred by a current client who gave an excellent review .
We were trying to get estimates and decide what to do .
I contacted their contact who responded quickly , efficiently not only with the drive but with estimates .
Turning the drive around was easy and timely .
I would recommend them to anyone .
They had exactly what I was looking for and the price was the best .
They worked with me when it was time for delivery .
I was able to pick the unit up at the depot as I was not going to be available at home .
The delivery was fast .
good clothes , good service
I really llke the way you display the clothes from various angles so I can see what they look like .
I do a lot of online shopping and your site is quite good .
I would like to see more variety of styles , though , and especially clothes for the business woman .
More suits , more variety in pants and more suit-appropriate tops .
Also more variety in pants- colours , textures , etc .
for a work environment .
Nygard is great quality and great fit at a great price point : I just want more !
Packing was out of this world
You checked before delivery to make sure the chairs I had ordered were correct , which they were .
Delivery of furniture was faultless .
Packaging was out of this world , packed with care and attention so nothing was damaged .
I'm in the US and I received my order exactly one week after it shipped -- and it shipped the day after I ordered .
Speedy , affordable , and excellent communication .
I highly recommend this site !
Good and speedy service , for the right price
Hello 3000RPM , I have bought a number of items and found you to be quick and accurate with my orders , only once did we have a problem but it was fixed to both our satisfaction . Thanks again 3000RPM .
will order again in the future .
Regards B . Clarke
I dont received my order ... and without attention for my claim .
Highly Recommend !
I bought from san Francisco herb years ago when I had a small herbal shop .
7 years later their products and service are still just as wonderful .
I use herbs mainly for home use now , and have never been disappointed .
Avoid like the Plague
I have been using Meteor Meet and Greet for many years which I have never had a problem , however I booked Through Britannia Airport Parking for a period of 11 days , what interested me was the Valeting service , because we were arriving early hours in the morning and later that day we had a wedding to attend and my car was being used to transport other guests .
Easy to Use Website - But Price was Pretty Average
Easy to Use Website - But Price was Pretty Average
My new , trusted source for affordable , quality prize ribbons and medals .
Excellent service , value and product .
It Stunk !
I had trouble accessing the completion part of my order the last two times I tried to shop online .
I requested assistance , got none , wrote and said you needn't send me any more great deals online , as I wasn't going to go to all the work of getting my order ready , then being able to do nothing with it .
So , friend to friend , Goodbye Nygard !
Probably the easiest company I've ever worked with
From the time I contacted them to placing the order to receiving my order , iPromo was professional , friendly , and prompt .
I will definately order from Inkgarden again .
The software is very user friendly , and the finished product was exactly what I expected and had ordered .
The only reason for the 4 stars is that about 12 or so of the cards were defective .
it was actually split about 3/4 's of the way on the fold .
It 's a machine/quality control issue .
The product itself was beautiful , the quality of the paper outstanding .
The prices extremely reasonable , and with the discount codes even better !
Thank you Inkgarden .
Could be improved .
Arrived at Thrifty to pick up my car at CHC Airport and they had no record that I was mean to have a free GPS with my car , didn't even know who Bliss was .
They didn't even offer to check , I had to use my phone to show them the website and where it said the car includes a free GPS .
Then the GPS they eventually gave me didn't work ,
Quick , reliable service .
When I first stumbled upon this site I was browsing the Gamespot internet forum ; in this forum a member was asking whether or not this site was to be trusted , other members confirmed that it could indeed be trusted .
I was curious as to why they were asking this , I followed the link to the site , where I was met by ( I hope you don't mind me saying ) quite an ugly site .
My immediate reaction was that the site did look a little suspect , as I am used to buying from large companies with flashier websites .
However I decided to look a bit further and discovered that the prices on display seemed too good to be true .
After looking around for a while and debating whether to try purchasing something , I decided to give it a go , after all people have stated it is legitimate .
The serial key I purchased arrived within a minute of payment , and worked perfectly when entered into steam .
What more can I say .
The price was unmatched and I could not have asked for the serial to arrive any faster !
So what are you waiting for !
This has taught me not to judge a book by its cover !
I have recommended this site to several people who have all followed up with successful purchases .
super fast delivery
I have used Lenstore on more than one occasion and would recommend them again and again . The " reorder " facility is great as you don't have to remember your prescription and the delivery is superfast
Really love the variety for all occasions on shoes , dresses and accessories !
Really love the variety and huge amount of shoes and dresses to shop for !
Prices are much better for my budget and I enjoy shopping on your site !
My go to place for supplements !
I have ordered from Supplement Warehouse man times before , and as far as I'm concerned will continue to do so .
I always get what I ordered in a timely fashion , and price is always the best anywhere !
Quick and Easy !
Large variety of products
Product is good , but expensive delivery and no refund on tax
Will shop elsewhere
Great product ... Great service
Ordered 2 ASO evo braces and got them in 2 days .
I needed a question answered and when I emailed mike I got a quick reply .... on the weekend .
Very good service .
I have played with regular ASO braces for years and this was my first try using the evo .
They seem to be a nice upgrade .
More comfortable and provide a bit more support as well .
Great experience with this company and product .
Very good service
Good rate offered and cash was delivered on time .
Will use again
Good product , good price , good service
Product is as described and is original RayBan , not copy .
On line price is competitive for this product .
Business kept me informed of order progress .
Delivered within a few days of order .
Excellent service with excellent prices
Always find the service from Merlin first class .
The prices are always very competitive and the service is excellent .
Can't say more .
They sell you a product with simplicity and speed .
Most other companies are slow when comfirming your purchase , they are so simple that it 's just amazing , I buy from them now all the time because it 's just so quick .
Mike has way too much fun .
Bought this HOG suit at Beneath The Sea 2013 show .
The first suit was a little small , Mike made sure that the size/ suit got taken care of .
The replacement suit fits GREAT , works GREAT , looks GREAT .
I couldn't be more pleased with DRIS and Mike .
He must enjoy what he does because he sure is good at it . ﻿
very good service i was very impressed
Fort the right part info a quicktime '
I bought a passager mirror from PartsGreek and found it to substander .
I reinstalled it 3 times it still wouldn't fit properly .
Keep seaching for parts this site will not satisify your requirements .
Beautiful dress - fits perfect !!
Needed a great dress that fit perfect for my daughter to use in a competitive tap dance competition .
She is very petite and I couldn't find anything .
Then found Light in the Box and found the perfect dress to evoke the right era and was able to get it custom fit .
The dress arrived and it fits her perfectly and is the perfect dress for to competition .
Good as their word
Sent it out as promised , right item , s&h was a fair price would buy from them again
We have 3 medium sized dogs and being that my husband has sustained injuries to both of his shoulders , PetFlow . com has been a life saver .
Their shipments are dependable , I can change my order when I feel necessary and I only need to get them from my front door to the garage .
Beats getting 3 XL bags of dog food into the cart , out of the cart , into the car , out of the car , into the house etc .
I am so glad I found you !
the goods I ordered arrived swiftly
I selected a certain color scheme to match a theme for a baby shower .
I was delighted with the results .
I purchased small tags and coaster .
The only issue I have is that I think the price is way too expensive .
Like I said , I was looking for a certain look and I could only find the pattern on this website .
I didn't have time to look further .
This put a big dent in my budget .
Trustworthy and convenient
Hostelworld is really great , mainly because of the simple function of reviews .
Through them you get an updated view of the hostel in question , and you can see the pro 's and con 's of the place .
I mean , some people prefer cleanliness and quiet , while some prefer a hostel where you can find friends to chat and party with , and through the reviews you will see if it 's what you're looking for !
Also , the payment and all those parts of finding accommodation also works great through Hostelworld , so I will definitely continue us the website whenever I want to stay at hostels around the world .
Better than expected
I was worried about the quality of the part when I saw the price but took a chance .
I was completely satisfied .
Made a mistake , but they put me right
I left the times at 12.00 for departure and return , and when I noticed - after I had paid - I thought I was going to be charged for my mistake , but one quick phone call and they put it right there and then and sent me an email to confirm the times were changed correctly .
Well done !
Brilliant treatment for a donut like me !
Top rate prices and service
WCS ' website is easy to navigate .
Pricing is comparable with other online outlets and their shipping in next day .
What more can I ask for .
Highly recommended .
The efficiency with which the whole process was conducted from ordering to delivery was first class .
Communication was great and I was kept in touch by email with progress all along .
I love the furniture , it 's good quality , well built and very sturdy .
There are no hidden nasties or differences from anythng shown on the website .
Detaching 24 handles and refitting them on the outside of the drawers was a bit tedious but worth the effort ; everything looks great .
I had to phone to amend an order and that was handled perfectly .
The delivery men were nice guys too .
All in all , highly recommended .
Duke Vien Best Customer Service I Have ever experienced !!!!!!
I shop at Amiclubwear frequently .
I recently purchased an item from amiclubwear and they sent me the wrong product twice .
I called in and had the pleasure to speak with Duke Vien .
Duke was very helpful and made sure I got the correct package .
